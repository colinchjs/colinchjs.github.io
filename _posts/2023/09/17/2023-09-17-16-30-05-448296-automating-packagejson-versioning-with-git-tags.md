## Introduction

Managing versions in a project is crucial for tracking changes and ensuring compatibility. In JavaScript projects, the `package.json` file holds important metadata, including version information. Manually updating the version in the `package.json` file can be cumbersome, especially in a collaborative development environment. In this blog post, we'll explore how to automate the versioning process by synchronizing the `package.json` version with Git tags.

## Pre-requisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following pre-requisites:
- Git installed on your machine
- A JavaScript project with a `package.json` file

## Steps

### Step 1: Add Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that are triggered in response to specific Git events. We'll create a Git hook that updates the `package.json` version whenever we create a new Git tag.

To begin, navigate to the root directory of your Git repository and create a directory called `.git/hooks` if it doesn't already exist. Then, create a file named `post-checkout` inside the `.git/hooks` directory.

Next, open the `post-checkout` file in a text editor and add the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if [ -n "$GIT_REFLOG_ACTION" ]; then
  git describe --tags --abbrev=0 | xargs -I '{}' sh -c 'jq ".version = {}" package.json > package.json.tmp && mv package.json.tmp package.json'
fi
```

Save the file and make it executable by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-checkout
```

### Step 2: Create a Git Tag

Now that we have the Git hook in place, we can create a new Git tag which will automatically update the `package.json` version.

To create a tag, use the following command:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

Replace `v1.0.0` with the desired tag name. Alternatively, you can create tags through Git GUI tools or integrated development environments (IDEs) that have Git support.

### Step 3: Verify the Version Update

To verify that the `package.json` version has been updated, you can run the following command:

```bash
cat package.json | grep version
```

If everything was set up correctly, you should see the new version number in the output.

## Conclusion

By automating the package.json versioning process using Git tags, you can save time and ensure that version information is accurately synchronized with your Git repository. This enables easy tracking of changes and compatibility management across your JavaScript projects.

Remember to commit and push your tags to share the version updates with your collaborators.
