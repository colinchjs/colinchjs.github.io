In today's digital landscape, ensuring the security of user credentials is of utmost importance. With the increasing number of cybersecurity threats, it is crucial for developers to implement robust password hashing and storage mechanisms in their applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement secure password hashing and storage in Express.js applications.

## Why Password Hashing?

Storing passwords in plain text is a major security vulnerability. In the event of a data breach, attackers can easily access and misuse user passwords. To mitigate this risk, password hashing is employed.

Password hashing is the process of converting a user's password into a fixed-length hash value, which is then stored in the database. When a user logs in, their entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash value. If they match, the user is granted access.

## bcrypt: The Hashing Algorithm of Choice

One of the most widely used algorithms for password hashing is bcrypt. Bcrypt is a key derivation function that employs the Blowfish cryptographic algorithm, providing a secure and slow password hashing mechanism. Slowing down the hashing process helps thwart brute-force attacks, as each guess takes significant time to compute.

To use bcrypt in an Express.js application, you'll need to install the `bcrypt` package by running the following command:

```shell
npm install bcrypt
```

## Implementing Password Hashing in Express.js

First, import the `bcrypt` package in your Express.js application:

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
```

When a user registers or changes their password, you'll need to generate a hash and store it in the database. Here's an example of how you can generate a hash using bcrypt:

```javascript
const password = 'myPassword';
const saltRounds = 10;

bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  
  // Store the hash in the database
  // ...
});
```

In the above code, we provide the user's password and the number of salt rounds to the `bcrypt.hash()` function. The salt rounds control the computational cost of the hashing algorithm. The higher the number, the slower the hashing process. It is generally recommended to use a value between 10-12 for the salt rounds, balancing security and performance.

To verify the user's entered password, you can compare the hash stored in the database with the entered password using the `bcrypt.compare()` function. Here's an example:

```javascript
const enteredPassword = 'myPassword';
const storedHash = 'storedHashFromDatabase';

bcrypt.compare(enteredPassword, storedHash, function(err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  
  if (result) {
    // Passwords match, grant access
    // ...
  } else {
    // Passwords do not match, deny access
    // ...
  }
});
```

In the above code, if the `result` is `true`, it means the entered password matches the stored hash, and you can grant access accordingly.

## Conclusion

Implementing secure password hashing and storage is a critical aspect of any web application. By using bcrypt in Express.js applications, developers can ensure that user credentials are properly protected. Remember to use a strong hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt, and consider adjusting the number of salt rounds to strike a balance between security and performance.
