In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate a notification system into an Express.js application using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). FCM allows you to send push notifications to your users on various platforms, including Android and iOS. 

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Express.js and JavaScript

## Setting up Firebase Cloud Messaging

1. Create a Firebase project by visiting the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2. Set up a new Firebase project and enable Firebase Cloud Messaging for your project.

3. Obtain the Server Key and the Sender ID from the **Project Settings** -> **Cloud Messaging** tab. You will need these later to send push notifications.

## Setting up the Express.js Application

1. Initialize a new Express.js project by running `npm init` in your project directory and follow the prompts to create a `package.json` file.

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install express body-parser firebase-admin
```

3. Create a new file named `app.js` in your project directory and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const admin = require('firebase-admin');

const app = express();

// Parse incoming request bodies
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Initialize Firebase Admin SDK
admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert('path/to/serviceAccountKey.json'), // Replace with the path to your service account key JSON file
});

// Define a route to handle sending notifications
app.post('/send', (req, res) => {
  const { token, title, body } = req.body;

  // Create a notification message
  const message = {
    notification: {
      title,
      body,
    },
    token,
  };

  // Send the notification
  admin.messaging().send(message)
    .then((response) => {
      console.log('Notification sent successfully:', response);
      res.send('Notification sent successfully');
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error sending notification:', error);
      res.status(500).send('Error sending notification');
    });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

4. Replace the `path/to/serviceAccountKey.json` with the path to your Firebase service account key JSON file. This file can be downloaded from the Firebase console.

## Sending Notifications with Express.js

To send a notification, you can send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/send` with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "token": "<device-token>",
  "title": "Notification Title",
  "body": "Notification Body"
}
```

Make sure to replace `<device-token>` with the FCM token of the device you want to send the notification to. You can obtain this token on the client-side by using the Firebase Cloud Messaging SDK for your respective platform.

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial, you have learned how to integrate a notification system in an Express.js application using Firebase Cloud Messaging. You can now send push notifications to your users on various platforms. This can greatly enhance user engagement and keep your users updated with the latest information.
