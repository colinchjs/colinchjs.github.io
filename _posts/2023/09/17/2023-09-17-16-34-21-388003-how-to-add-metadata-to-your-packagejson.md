Metadata in a `package.json` file plays an important role in providing essential information about your Node.js project. It includes details such as the project name, version, description, author, and more. Adding proper metadata helps users understand your project and facilitates integration with package managers and build tools.

In this blog post, we will learn how to add metadata to your `package.json` file.

## Step 1: Locate your package.json file
Navigate to the root directory of your Node.js project and locate the `package.json` file. This file is typically found in the root directory of your project and acts as a manifest for your application.

## Step 2: Open package.json
Open the `package.json` file using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

## Step 3: Add metadata
Inside `package.json`, you will find various fields for adding metadata. Here are some of the common fields you can add:

1. **name**: Specify the name of your project. This field is required and should be unique.
    ```json
    "name": "my-awesome-project",
    ```

2. **version**: Specify the version of your project using semantic versioning. 
    ```json
    "version": "1.0.0",
    ```

3. **description**: Provide a brief description of your project.
    ```json
    "description": "An amazing Node.js project",
    ```

4. **author**: Add the author of the project.
    ```json
    "author": "John Doe",
    ```

5. **license**: Specify the license under which your project is released.
    ```json
    "license": "MIT",
    ```

## Step 4: Save the changes
After adding the metadata, save the `package.json` file.

## Step 5: Verify metadata
To verify if the metadata is included in your `package.json` file, you can use the command `npm view <package-name>` where `<package-name>` is the name specified in the `name` field of your `package.json` file. It will display the metadata along with other information related to the package.

That's it! You have successfully added metadata to your `package.json` file. Metadata helps in providing valuable information about your project to users and other tools. Make sure to keep it updated and accurate.
