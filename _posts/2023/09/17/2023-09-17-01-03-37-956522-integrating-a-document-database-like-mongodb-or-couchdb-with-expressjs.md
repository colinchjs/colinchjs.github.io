In modern web development, building applications often involves working with document databases. These databases offer flexibility in storing and querying data, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate a document database like MongoDB or CouchDB with Express.js - a popular web application framework for Node.js.

## Choosing the Document Database

Before diving into the integration process, let's briefly compare MongoDB and CouchDB to make an informed decision about which one to use.

### MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular and widely-used NoSQL database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents. It offers powerful querying capabilities and supports dynamic schemas, making it suitable for applications that require high scalability and real-time data updates. MongoDB has extensive community support and a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries.

### CouchDB

CouchDB, another open-source NoSQL database, also utilizes JSON documents for storing data. One of its key features is its ability to seamlessly sync data across devices and platforms. CouchDB supports master-master replication, making it ideal for applications that require offline synchronization and data replication among distributed nodes.

Both MongoDB and CouchDB have their strengths and weaknesses, so choose the one that best fits your project requirements and preferences.

## Integrating MongoDB/CouchDB with Express.js

Now, let's dive into the integration process of MongoDB or CouchDB with Express.js. For the sake of simplicity, we'll focus on MongoDB in this blog post.

### Step 1: Install the Required Packages

To begin, first ensure that you have MongoDB installed on your system. Then, in your Express.js project directory, install the following dependencies:

```
npm install mongoose
```

Mongoose is an object modeling tool designed for MongoDB, providing a straightforward way to interact with the database.

### Step 2: Set Up Connection

In your Express.js application, create a file called `db.js` (or any name you prefer) to establish a MongoDB connection. Inside the file, include the following code:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/my-database', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
})
  .then(() => console.log('Connected to MongoDB'))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', error));
```

Ensure to replace `'mongodb://localhost:27017/my-database'` with the actual URL of your MongoDB database.

### Step 3: Define Models and Schemas

To interact with MongoDB collections, you'll need to define models and schemas. In a new file `models.js`, start by importing `mongoose` and defining a schema for your documents:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
  // Define your schema fields here
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  email: String,
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', schema); // Create a model

module.exports = { User }; // Export the model
```

Feel free to customize the schema fields according to your application's needs.

### Step 4: Perform CRUD Operations

With the connection established and models defined, you can perform CRUD operations on the MongoDB database. In your Express.js routes or controllers, you can now use the `User` model to interact with the database:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { User } = require('./models');

const router = express.Router();

// Create a new user
router.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.create(req.body);
    res.json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to create user' });
  }
});

// Retrieve all users
router.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const users = await User.find();
    res.json(users);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve users' });
  }
});

// Update a user
router.put('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, { new: true });
    res.json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to update user' });
  }
});

// Delete a user
router.delete('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    await User.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
    res.sendStatus(204);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to delete user' });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

Ensure to configure appropriate error handling and input validation in your routes for real-world applications.

## Conclusion

Integrating a document database like MongoDB or CouchDB with Express.js opens up opportunities for building flexible and scalable web applications. In this blog post, we explored how to integrate MongoDB specifically, but the same principles can be applied to CouchDB as well. By following the outlined steps, you can seamlessly integrate a document database into your Express.js application and start leveraging its powerful features.
