Cross-domain requests occur when a web page makes a request to a different domain than the one it originated from. These requests are typically blocked by browsers due to security restrictions known as the Same-Origin Policy. One way to work around this limitation is by using a proxy server. In this post, we will explore how to use Express.js as a proxy server to handle cross-domain requests.

## Why Use a Proxy Server?

A proxy server acts as an intermediary between the client and the target server. By routing requests through the proxy server, the client can make requests to different domains while appearing to come from the same origin. This allows bypassing the Same-Origin Policy restriction enforced by browsers.

## Setting Up Express.js as a Proxy Server

To use Express.js as a proxy server, we need to install the required dependencies first:

```bash
npm install express http-proxy-middleware
```

We use the `http-proxy-middleware` package to create a proxy instance in our Express.js application. Let's create a new file `proxy.js` and import the necessary modules:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');

const app = express();

const targetUrl = 'https://api.example.com'; // The URL of the target server you want to proxy to

app.use('/', createProxyMiddleware({ target: targetUrl, changeOrigin: true }));

const port = 3000; // Port on which the proxy server will run
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Proxy server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

In the above code, we create an instance of the Express.js application and define the `targetUrl` variable with the URL of the server we want to proxy to. We then use the `createProxyMiddleware` function to create a proxy that redirects requests to the target server.

Note the `changeOrigin` option which automatically changes the `Origin` header of the request to match the target server's domain. This ensures that the target server accepts the request as if it originated from its own domain.

To start the proxy server, run the following command:

```bash
node proxy.js
```

Now, any request made to the proxy server will be forwarded to the target server defined by `targetUrl`.

## Using the Proxy Server

To make use of the proxy server, update the URLs in your client-side code to point to the proxy server instead. For example, if you were making a request to `https://api.example.com/data`, you would now make the request to `http://localhost:3000/data`.

When the client-side code sends a request to the proxy server, the Express.js application forwards the request to the target server and returns the response back to the client. The client-side code is unaware that the request was processed through a proxy.

## Conclusion

Using Express.js as a proxy server is an effective way to handle cross-domain requests and bypass the Same-Origin Policy restriction enforced by browsers. By creating a proxy server with Express.js, we can easily route requests to different domains and access data from external APIs.
