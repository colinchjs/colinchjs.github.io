Have you ever struggled to keep track of your tasks and appointments? A task scheduling application can help you stay organized and manage your time effectively. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a task scheduling application using JavaScript and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

## What is MVC?

MVC is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three main components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model represents the data and business logic, the View handles the presentation and user interface, and the Controller manages the interactions and updates between the Model and the View.

## Setting Up the Project

To begin, let's set up our project structure. Create a new folder for your application and open a terminal window in that directory. Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

```javascript
npm init
```

Next, install the necessary dependencies:

```javascript
npm install express mongoose
```
