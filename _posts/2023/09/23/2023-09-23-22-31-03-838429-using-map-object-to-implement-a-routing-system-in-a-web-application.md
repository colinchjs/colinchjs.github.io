Routing is a crucial aspect of web applications, enabling navigation between different pages or views. While there are various ways to implement a routing system, using a **Map object** can provide a robust and efficient solution. In this blog post, we will explore how the Map object can be used to create a routing system in a web application.

### What is a Map object?

The **Map object** is a built-in data structure in JavaScript that allows you to store key-value pairs. Unlike regular JavaScript objects, the keys in a Map object can be of any data type, making it a versatile choice for implementing a routing system.

### Implementing a basic routing system

Let's start by creating a basic routing system using the Map object. First, we need to define the routes and their corresponding handlers:

```javascript
const routes = new Map();
routes.set('/', homeHandler);
routes.set('/about', aboutHandler);
routes.set('/contact', contactHandler);
```

In this example, the keys in the Map object represent the different routes, and the values are the corresponding handler functions.

Next, we can write a function to handle the navigation and execute the appropriate handler based on the current URL:

```javascript
function navigate() {
  const path = window.location.pathname;
  
  // Check if the current path exists in the routes Map
  if (routes.has(path)) {
    const handler = routes.get(path);
    handler();
  } else {
    // Handle 404 - Page not found
    handleNotFound();
  }
}
```

Here, we retrieve the current `pathname` from `window.location` and check if it exists in the routes Map. If the route is found, we execute the corresponding handler function. Otherwise, we handle the 404 scenario by calling the `handleNotFound()` function.

To complete the routing system, we need to call the `navigate()` function when the page loads and whenever there is a change in the URL:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', navigate);
window.addEventListener('popstate', navigate);
```

Now, whenever the page loads or the URL changes, the `navigate()` function will be called, ensuring that the appropriate page content is rendered.

### Advanced routing features

The basic routing system we implemented can be extended to include advanced features such as parameterized routes, query parameters, and route guards. With the Map object as the underlying data structure, managing and adding new routes becomes straightforward.

### Conclusion

The Map object provides an efficient and flexible way to implement a routing system in a web application. By defining routes and their handlers in a Map object, we can easily navigate between different pages and handle various scenarios. The basic routing system can be extended to include more advanced features, making it a solid choice for building a robust web application.
