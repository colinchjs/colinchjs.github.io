In today's tech-driven world, **JavaScript** has become the go-to programming language for building interactive and dynamic web applications. One popular use case for JavaScript is creating a calendar application that allows users to schedule and manage their events seamlessly. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a **JavaScript Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern-based calendar application.

## What is the MVC Pattern?

The MVC pattern is a software architectural design that separates the application into three interconnected components: the **Model**, the **View**, and the **Controller**.

- The **Model** represents the data and business logic of the application.
- The **View** is responsible for rendering the user interface.
- The **Controller** handles user interactions and updates the model and view accordingly.

This pattern promotes the separation of concerns, making the code more maintainable and scalable.

## Setting up the Project

To start building our calendar application, we need to set up the project structure and install any necessary dependencies. Create a project directory and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir calendar-app
cd calendar-app
npm init
```

Once the `npm init` command is executed, follow the prompts to create a `package.json` file. Next, let's install some dependencies:

```bash
npm install express --save
npm install ejs --save
```

## Creating the Model

The first step is to define the data structure for our calendar events. In the `models/Event.js` file, we can create a simple `Event` class:

```javascript
class Event {
  constructor(title, description, date) {
    this.title = title;
    this.description = description;
    this.date = date;
  }
}
```

## Implementing the View

For the view component of our calendar application, we will use the **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** templating engine. EJS allows us to dynamically generate HTML content based on our data.

Create a `views` folder and a `views/home.ejs` file. In the `home.ejs`, we can define the basic structure of our calendar view:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Calendar App</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>My Calendar</h1>
  <!-- Calendar content will be generated dynamically -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Developing the Controller

The controller component is responsible for handling user interactions and updating the model and view accordingly. Create a `controllers/homeController.js` file and implement the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Event = require('../models/Event');

// Example route for displaying the calendar
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const events = []; // Fetch events from the model or a database
  res.render('home', { events }); // Pass the events data to the view
});

module.exports = router;
```

## Setting Up the Server

To run our calendar application, we need to set up a server to handle HTTP requests. Create an `app.js` file and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const homeController = require('./controllers/homeController');

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use('/css', express.static(__dirname + '/public/css'));
app.use('/', homeController);

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Running the Application

To start our calendar application, run the following command:

```bash
node app.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see the calendar view. At this point, the events are hardcoded, but you can easily modify the code to fetch events from a database or API.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to build a calendar application using the JavaScript MVC pattern. By following the separation of concerns provided by the MVC architecture, we can create a scalable and maintainable application. Remember to add your own features and styling to make your calendar application truly unique.
