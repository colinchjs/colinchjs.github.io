JavaScript MVC frameworks provide a way to structure and organize client-side web applications. One important aspect of these frameworks is the use of templating engines, which allow developers to separate logic and presentation in their code. In this blog post, we will explore some popular templating engines used in JavaScript MVC and discuss their features and benefits.

## 1. Handlebars.js

**Handlebars.js** is a widely-used templating engine that aims to provide a semantic and expressive syntax for creating dynamic templates. It is based on the Mustache template language but extends it with additional functionality.

Key Features:
- **Logic-less**: Handlebars.js templates are logic-less, meaning that they do not support complex logic such as conditionals and loops. Instead, Handlebars.js focuses on data interpolation and rendering.
- **Partial Templates**: Handlebars.js allows you to define reusable partial templates and include them in other templates. This promotes code reusability and modularity.
- **Helpers**: Handlebars.js provides a powerful helper system that allows you to extend the functionality of your templates. You can define custom helpers or use built-in ones for common tasks like formatting dates or iterating over arrays.

Example code using Handlebars.js:

```javascript
const template = Handlebars.compile(`
  <div>
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <p>{{content}}</p>
  </div>
`);

const data = {
  title: 'My Blog Post',
  content: 'This is the content of my blog post.'
};

const renderedHtml = template(data);
```

## 2. Mustache

**Mustache** is a logic-less templating engine that focuses on simplicity and ease of use. It aims to provide a clear separation between data and presentation, making it a popular choice for many JavaScript MVC frameworks.

Key Features:
- **Logic-less**: Mustache templates do not support complex logic like conditionals and loops. Instead, they rely on sections and variables for data interpolation.
- **Inheritance**: Mustache supports template inheritance, allowing you to define a base template and extend it with child templates. This promotes code reusability and consistency.
- **Multi-language Support**: Mustache is available in many programming languages, making it easy to share templates between different parts of your application.

Example code using Mustache:

```javascript
const template = `
  <div>
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <p>{{content}}</p>
  </div>`;

const data = {
  title: 'My Blog Post',
  content: 'This is the content of my blog post.'
};

const renderedHtml = Mustache.render(template, data);
```
