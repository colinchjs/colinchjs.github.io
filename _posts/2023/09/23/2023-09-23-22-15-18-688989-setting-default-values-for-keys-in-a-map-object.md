When working with JavaScript, you may often encounter situations where you want to set a default value for a key in a `Map` object. `Map` is a built-in data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs, similar to an object, but with more flexibility.

To set a default value for a key in a `Map` object, you can utilize the `get` method available on the `Map` prototype. This method allows you to access the value associated with a specific key. If the key does not exist, you can return a default value.

Here's an example of setting default values for keys in a `Map` object:

```javascript
// Create a new Map object
const myMap = new Map();

// Set a default value for a key
const defaultValue = 'Default Value';
const key = 'myKey';

// Get the value associated with the key, or return the default value if the key does not exist
const value = myMap.get(key) || defaultValue;

console.log(value); // Output: 'Default Value'
```

In the example above, we first create a new `Map` object called `myMap`. We then define a default value and a key. Next, we use the `get` method to retrieve the value associated with the key. If the key doesn't exist, the `get` method will return `undefined`. In this case, we use the logical OR operator (`||`) to return the default value instead.

Setting default values for keys in a `Map` object can be helpful when you want to ensure that accessing a key always returns a specific value, even if the key doesn't exist in the `Map`. This can help prevent unexpected errors and make your code more robust.
