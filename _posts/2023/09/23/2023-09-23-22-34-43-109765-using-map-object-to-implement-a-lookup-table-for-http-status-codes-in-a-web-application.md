Managing and handling HTTP status codes is a crucial aspect of web application development. A lookup table is often used to map numeric status codes to their corresponding human-readable descriptions.

To simplify this process, you can leverage the power of the `Map` object in JavaScript. The `Map` object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs that allows for efficient lookup and retrieval.

## Setting up the Map

First, let's create a Map object that will serve as our lookup table for HTTP status codes and their descriptions. We can define it in a separate module or directly in our web application code.

```javascript
const httpStatusCodes = new Map();

// Add some initial HTTP status codes and their descriptions
httpStatusCodes.set(200, 'OK');
httpStatusCodes.set(404, 'Not Found');
httpStatusCodes.set(500, 'Internal Server Error');
// ... add more status codes as needed
```

In the example above, we created a new Map object called `httpStatusCodes` and added a few common status codes along with their descriptions. Feel free to add more status codes based on your application's requirements.

## Retrieving Status Code Descriptions

To retrieve the description for a specific HTTP status code, simply use the `get` method of the Map object.

```javascript
const statusCode = 200;

const description = httpStatusCodes.get(statusCode);
console.log(description); // Output: "OK"
```

In the above code snippet, we specified the status code `200` and used the `get` method of the `httpStatusCodes` Map object to retrieve its corresponding description.

## Handling Unknown Status Codes

To handle scenarios where the requested status code is not present in the lookup table, you can provide a default description or handle it separately.

```javascript
const statusCode = 400;

const description = httpStatusCodes.get(statusCode);
if (description) {
  console.log(description);
} else {
  console.log("Unknown status code");
}
```

In the code snippet above, when the requested status code (`400` in this case) is not found in the Map object, the `get` method returns `undefined`. We can then handle the scenario by providing a default message or any other desired action.

## Conclusion

Using a `Map` object as a lookup table for HTTP status codes provides an efficient and convenient way to manage and retrieve status code information in a web application. It allows for easy addition of new codes and descriptions, as well as efficient retrieval for handling HTTP responses. So, consider implementing a `Map` object in your web application whenever you need to work with HTTP status codes.
