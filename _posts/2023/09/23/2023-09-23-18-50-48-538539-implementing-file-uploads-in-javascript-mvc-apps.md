Uploading files is a common requirement in many web applications. In this blog post, we will guide you on how to implement file uploads in JavaScript MVC apps.

## Step 1: Set up the HTML form

To allow users to select and upload files, we need to create an HTML form with an input element of type "file":

```html
<form id="uploadForm">
    <input type="file" name="myFile" id="fileInput">
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

## Step 2: Handle the file upload in the controller

In the controller, we need to handle the form submission and extract the uploaded file. Here's an example using a popular JavaScript MVC framework, **AngularJS**:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .controller('UploadController', function($scope, $http) {
    $scope.uploadFile = function() {
      var file = document.getElementById('fileInput').files[0];
      var formData = new FormData();
      formData.append('myFile', file);

      $http.post('/upload', formData, {
        transformRequest: angular.identity,
        headers: {'Content-Type': undefined}
      }).then(function(response) {
        // Handle success
        console.log('File uploaded successfully');
      }, function(error) {
        // Handle error
        console.error('File upload failed:', error);
      });
    };
  });
```

## Step 3: Implement the server-side logic

On the server-side, you need to handle the file upload request and save the file to the desired location. The exact implementation depends on your backend technology. Here's an example using **Node.js** and **Express.js**:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');

const app = express();
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('myFile'), (req, res) => {
  // Access the uploaded file using req.file
  // Process the file and save it to the desired location
  console.log('Received file:', req.file);

  res.status(200).send('File uploaded successfully');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');
});
```

Remember to install the necessary packages (`multer` in this case) using **npm**.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily implement file uploads in JavaScript MVC apps. Users will be able to select and upload files from their local system, and your server-side logic can handle the file processing and storage. Give it a try and enjoy the benefits of file uploads in your applications! #javascript #fileuploads
