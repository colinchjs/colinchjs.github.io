In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a quiz application using JavaScript and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern. This application will allow users to take a quiz and see their scores at the end. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will be using the following technologies and libraries:

- **JavaScript**: The programming language that we will use to build the quiz application.
- **MVC**: The architectural pattern that helps us separate concerns and ensure clean code organization.
- **HTML**: The markup language that we will use to structure the user interface.
- **CSS**: The styling language used to make the quiz application visually appealing.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework that provides pre-built UI components.

## Getting Started

First, let's set up the basic structure of our quiz application. Create an HTML file and add the necessary HTML elements to build the UI. Use Bootstrap to style the elements if desired.

Next, we will define the model, view, and controller components of our quiz application.

### Model

The model is responsible for managing the data and logic of our application. In this case, we will create a JavaScript class `Quiz` that contains the questions, answers, and scores.

```javascript
class Quiz {
  constructor() {
    this.questions = [];
    this.currentQuestionIndex = 0;
    this.score = 0;
  }

  addQuestion(question, answer) {
    this.questions.push({ question, answer });
  }

  checkAnswer(answer) {
    const currentQuestion = this.questions[this.currentQuestionIndex];
    if (answer === currentQuestion.answer) {
      this.score++;
    }
  }

  getNextQuestion() {
    this.currentQuestionIndex++;
    return this.questions[this.currentQuestionIndex];
  }

  getScore() {
    return this.score;
  }
}
```

### View

The view component is responsible for displaying the UI and handling user interactions. We will create JavaScript functions that interact with the HTML elements to show/hide questions and update the score.

```javascript
function showQuestion(question) {
  // Display the question on the UI
}

function showScore(score) {
  // Display the score on the UI
}

function showNextQuestion() {
  // Fetch the next question from the model and display it
}

function handleAnswerSubmission(answer) {
  // Call the checkAnswer method in the model and update the score
  // Show the next question or the final score if the quiz is over
}
```

### Controller

The controller component acts as the intermediary between the model and the view. It handles user interactions and updates the model and view accordingly.

```javascript
const quiz = new Quiz();

function init() {
  // Add questions to the model
}

function handleQuizStart() {
  // Initialize the quiz and display the first question
}

function handleAnswerSubmission(answer) {
  // Call the method in the model to check the answer and update the score
  // Show the next question or the final score if the quiz is over
}
```

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial, you have successfully built a quiz application using JavaScript and the MVC architecture pattern. This application can be easily expanded by adding more questions and customizing the UI according to your requirements. Using MVC helps keep the code organized and maintainable.

Now it's time to take your JavaScript skills to the next level and apply this knowledge to more complex applications. Happy coding!
