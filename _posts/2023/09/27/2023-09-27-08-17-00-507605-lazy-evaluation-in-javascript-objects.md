Lazy evaluation is a programming concept that allows for the deferred execution of code until its result is actually needed. In JavaScript, lazy evaluation can be particularly useful when dealing with expensive operations or computations that may not always be necessary.

One way to implement lazy evaluation in JavaScript is by utilizing JavaScript objects. By using objects, we can delay the execution of a function or computation until a property is accessed or a method is invoked.

Let's take a look at an example to better understand how lazy evaluation works in JavaScript objects.

```javascript
const expensiveComputation = () => {
  // Expensive calculation or operation here
  console.log('Performing expensive computation...');
  return 100;
};

const myObject = {
  // Property utilizing lazy evaluation
  get lazyProperty() {
    const value = expensiveComputation();
    delete this.lazyProperty;
    this.lazyProperty = value;
    return value;
  }
};

console.log(myObject.lazyProperty);  // Lazy computation executed for the first time
console.log(myObject.lazyProperty);  // No computation required, using cached value
```

In the example above, we have an `expensiveComputation` function that takes care of a costly calculation. Rather than executing this function immediately when the object is created, we define a getter method for a `lazyProperty` on the `myObject` object.

When the `lazyProperty` is accessed for the first time, the getter method is invoked. It performs the expensive computation, caches the result, and then redefines the getter method to directly return the cached value in subsequent calls. This way, the computation is only performed once, and future accesses to the `lazyProperty` will use the cached value.

Lazy evaluation can be beneficial for optimizing performance in situations where the calculated value is not always needed or may be expensive to compute. However, it is important to use lazy evaluation judiciously, as it may introduce complexity and potential maintenance issues.

By implementing lazy evaluation techniques in JavaScript objects, you can enhance the efficiency of your code and improve the overall performance of your application.
