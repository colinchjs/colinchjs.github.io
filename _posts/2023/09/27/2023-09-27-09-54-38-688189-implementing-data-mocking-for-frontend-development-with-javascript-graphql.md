As a frontend developer, you often need to work with APIs to retrieve data required for your application. In many cases, you may not have full control over the API or the backend is still under development. To overcome this challenge, you can use data mocking techniques to simulate the API responses and continue with frontend development.

In this article, we will explore how to implement data mocking for frontend development using JavaScript and GraphQL. We will use a popular JavaScript library called `graphql-tools` to create a mock GraphQL server.

## Setting up the Project

Before we start implementing data mocking, we need to set up a JavaScript project with GraphQL dependencies. You can use `npm` or `yarn` to initialize the project and install the required packages:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install graphql graphql-tools
```

## Creating a Mock GraphQL Schema

The first step is to define a mock GraphQL schema that represents the data structure of the API. You can create a file named `schema.js` and define your schema using the GraphQL schema language:

```javascript
// schema.js
const { gql } = require('graphql');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    email: String!
  }

  type Query {
    getUser(id: ID!): User
  }
`;

module.exports = typeDefs;
```

In this example, we define a `User` type with `id`, `name`, and `email` fields. We also define a `Query` type with a `getUser` query that takes an `id` as an argument and returns a `User`.

## Implementing the Mock Resolvers

The next step is to implement the mock resolvers that will generate the mock data for the defined schema. You can create another file named `resolvers.js` and implement the resolvers:

```javascript
// resolvers.js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getUser: (_, { id }) => {
      // Generate mock user data based on the id
      const user = {
        id,
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'johndoe@example.com'
      };

      return user;
    }
  }
};

module.exports = resolvers;
```
In this example, we implement the resolver for the `getUser` query. It generates a mock user object with a given `id`.

## Creating the Mock Server

Now that we have the schema and resolvers in place, we can create the mock GraphQL server using the `graphql-tools` library. Create a file named `server.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
// server.js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const typeDefs = require('./schema');
const resolvers = require('./resolvers');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`Mock server running at ${url}`);
});
```

## Testing the Data Mocking

To test the data mocking, you can run the mock server using the command:

```bash
node server.js
```

Now you can open the GraphQL playground at the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:4000) and execute queries against the mock server.

For example, you can execute the following query to retrieve a user:

```graphql
{
  getUser(id: "1") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

The mock server will generate the mock user data and return it as a response.

## Conclusion

Data mocking is a useful technique for frontend development when working with APIs that are not available or still under development. By using JavaScript and GraphQL, we can easily create a mock server that simulates the API responses and enables us to continue with frontend development.

By implementing data mocking, you can save time and iterate quickly during the frontend development process. Just remember to replace the mocked data with the real data once the API is available.
