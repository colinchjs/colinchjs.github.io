Lazy evaluation is a programming technique where the evaluation of an expression is delayed until its value is actually required. This can be beneficial in terms of performance, as it allows us to avoid unnecessary computations.

In JavaScript, lazy evaluation is not natively supported. However, we can implement it manually using closures. Let's explore how we can achieve lazy evaluation in JavaScript step by step.

## Step 1: Create a `lazy` function

First, we need to create a `lazy` function that takes in a function as its argument. This function will return another function that, when called, will evaluate the original function.

```javascript
function lazy(fn) {
  var evaluated = false;
  var value;

  return function() {
    if (!evaluated) {
      value = fn();
      evaluated = true;
    }
    return value;
  };
}
```

## Step 2: Usage

Now that we have defined our `lazy` function, let's use it to implement lazy evaluation.

```javascript
function expensiveComputation() {
  console.log("Performing expensive computation...");
  return 42;
}

var lazyComputation = lazy(expensiveComputation);

console.log("Before evaluating lazyComputation");
// The expensive computation is not performed yet

console.log(lazyComputation());
// Performing expensive computation...
// 42

console.log(lazyComputation());
// 42

console.log("After evaluating lazyComputation");
// The expensive computation is not performed again
```

In the above example, the `expensiveComputation` function is only evaluated when the `lazyComputation` function is called for the first time. Subsequent calls to `lazyComputation` will return the already computed value without performing the expensive computation again.

## Step 3: Benefits of Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation can be particularly useful when dealing with computationally expensive operations or when working with large datasets. By deferring the evaluation until it is actually needed, we can optimize the performance of our code.

Furthermore, lazy evaluation can also help with control flow. It allows us to write code that only evaluates certain parts of an expression if necessary, leading to cleaner and more concise code.

## Conclusion

Although JavaScript doesn't have native support for lazy evaluation, we can implement it manually using closures. By using the `lazy` function defined in this article, we can delay the evaluation of computationally expensive operations until they are actually required, improving the performance and efficiency of our code.
