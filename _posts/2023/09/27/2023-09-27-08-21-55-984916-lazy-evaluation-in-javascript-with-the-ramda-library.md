Lazy evaluation is a technique used in programming languages where expressions are evaluated only when their values are actually needed. This can improve both performance and memory efficiency. In JavaScript, one way to implement lazy evaluation is by using the Ramda library.

## What is Ramda?

[Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) is a functional programming library for JavaScript that provides a collection of utility functions to make functional programming easier. Ramda promotes immutability, pure functions, and functional composition.

One of the key features of Ramda is its support for lazy evaluation. This allows you to create "thunks" - functions that represent suspended computations. These thunks are only evaluated when their values are requested.

## Lazy Evaluation with `R.thunkify`

Ramda provides the `R.thunkify` function, which allows you to create thunks from regular functions. Thunks created with `R.thunkify` are lazy and memoized, meaning that the result of the computation is cached and reused when the thunk is called again.

Here's an example of using `R.thunkify` to implement lazy evaluation:

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => {
  console.log('Adding...', a, b);
  return a + b;
}

const lazyAdd = R.thunkify(add);

const result = lazyAdd(5, 7); // No output yet

console.log(result()); // Output: "Adding... 5 7\n12"
console.log(result()); // Output: "12" (cached result)
```

In the above example, the `add` function is wrapped using `R.thunkify`, creating `lazyAdd` which is a thunk. When `lazyAdd` is invoked using `result()`, the `add` function is called, and the result is returned. On subsequent invocations of `result()`, the cached result is returned without recalculating.

## Lazy Evaluation with `R.compose`

Another way to achieve lazy evaluation with Ramda is to use the `R.compose` function. `R.compose` creates a lazy pipeline of functions - the output of one function is passed as the input to the next function in the pipeline only when the result is needed.

Here's an example of using `R.compose` to implement lazy evaluation:

```javascript
const double = x => {
  console.log('Doubling...', x);
  return x * 2;
}

const triple = x => {
  console.log('Tripling...', x);
  return x * 3;
}

const lazyPipeline = R.compose(double, triple);

const result = lazyPipeline(5); // No output yet

console.log(result); // Output: "Doubling... 15\n30"
```

In the above example, the `double` and `triple` functions are composed using `R.compose`, creating `lazyPipeline`. When `lazyPipeline` is invoked with `result`, the `triple` function is called, and its output is passed to the `double` function. The final result is then returned. Only the necessary computations are performed.

## Conclusion

Lazy evaluation is a powerful technique that can greatly improve performance and memory efficiency in JavaScript. With the help of the Ramda library, you can easily implement lazy evaluation using `R.thunkify` and `R.compose`. By leveraging lazy evaluation, you can optimize your code and minimize unnecessary computations.
