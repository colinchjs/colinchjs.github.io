Lazy evaluation is a programming technique where the evaluation of an expression is delayed until its result is actually needed. This can be particularly useful when dealing with infinite sequences of data, as it allows us to generate and process elements on the fly, without the need to compute the entire sequence upfront.

In JavaScript, we can implement lazy evaluation using generators and iterator protocol. Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing us to generate a sequence of values on demand.

Let's take a look at a simple example of implementing lazy evaluation with infinite sequences in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Define a generator function for an infinite sequence of natural numbers
function* naturals() {
    let num = 1;
    while (true) {
        yield num;
        num++;
    }
}

// Create an iterator for the naturals sequence
const sequence = naturals();

// Print the first 5 elements of the sequence
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(sequence.next().value);
}
```

In the code above, we define the `naturals` generator function that generates an infinite sequence of natural numbers. Inside the function, we use a `while` loop to continuously yield the next number in the sequence.

We then create an iterator for the `naturals` sequence and use it to print the first 5 elements of the sequence.

The output of the above code will be:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

Notice that we don't have to compute the entire sequence upfront. The generator function allows us to generate and consume elements of the sequence as needed.

Lazy evaluation can be a powerful technique when dealing with large data sets or situations where we don't need to process the entire sequence at once. It can help improve performance and memory usage by only computing what is necessary.

With lazy evaluation, we can easily work with infinite sequences, generating elements only when needed, and avoiding the need to store or calculate the entire sequence upfront.
