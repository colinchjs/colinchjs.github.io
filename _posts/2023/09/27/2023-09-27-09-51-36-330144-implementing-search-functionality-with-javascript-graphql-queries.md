```javascript
import { gql } from 'graphql-tag';

// Define the GraphQL query for searching
const SEARCH_QUERY = gql`
  query Search($keyword: String!) {
    search(keyword: $keyword) {
      results {
        id
        title
        description
        // Add more fields if needed
      }
    }
  }
`;

// Function to make GraphQL search query
const search = async (keyword) => {
  try {
    const response = await client.query({
      query: SEARCH_QUERY,
      variables: { keyword },
    });

    const results = response.data.search.results;
    console.log(results);
    // Process the search results
  
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error while searching:', error);
  }
};

// Example usage
search('Javascript GraphQL'); // Replace with your own search term
```

## Introduction

Adding search functionality to a website or application can greatly enhance user experience. With the rise of GraphQL, it has become easier to implement powerful search features using Javascript. In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement search functionality using Javascript and GraphQL queries.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you will need:

- Basic knowledge of Javascript and GraphQL
- A GraphQL API endpoint

## Steps to implement search functionality

1. Install necessary dependencies:
   - [graphql-tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-tag): A JavaScript template literal tag that parses GraphQL queries.
   - [apollo-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-client): A fully-featured, production-ready GraphQL client for JavaScript.

2. Declare the GraphQL search query:
   - Use the `gql` tag from `graphql-tag` to define the search query.
   - Customize the query based on your GraphQL schema and fields you want to search.

3. Create a function to perform the search:
   - Use an asynchronous function, `search`, to send the GraphQL query to the API.
   - Pass the search keyword as a variable to the query.
   - Handle the response and process the search results as required.

4. Invoke the search function with the desired search keyword:
   - Replace `'Javascript GraphQL'` with your own search term.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we discussed how to implement search functionality using Javascript and GraphQL queries. By leveraging GraphQL, you can easily build powerful and flexible search features in your applications. Experiment with different query structures and explore the full potential of GraphQL to enhance the search capabilities of your projects.
