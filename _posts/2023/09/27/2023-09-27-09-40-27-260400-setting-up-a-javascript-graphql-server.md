GraphQL is a powerful query language that allows developers to define the structure of the data they need from an API. In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up a JavaScript GraphQL server.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js

## Step 1: Initialize a Node.js Project

First, let's create a new directory for our project and navigate into it using the command line. Then, run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

```
npm init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file in the project directory.

## Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

Next, we need to install the necessary dependencies for our GraphQL server. Run the following command to install `express` and `graphql`:

```
npm install express graphql
```

## Step 3: Create a GraphQL Schema

Now, let's create a file called `schema.js` to define our GraphQL schema. In this file, we will define the structure and types of our data.

```javascript
const { GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLSchema, GraphQLString } = require('graphql');

const UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'User',
  fields: {
    id: { type: GraphQLString },
    name: { type: GraphQLString },
    email: { type: GraphQLString },
  },
});

const QueryType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  fields: {
    user: {
      type: UserType,
      resolve: () => {
        // Resolve logic to fetch user data from the database
      },
    },
  },
});

const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
  query: QueryType,
});

module.exports = schema;
```

In this example, we define a `UserType` with `id`, `name`, and `email` fields. We also define a `QueryType` with a `user` field that resolves to a `UserType` object.

## Step 4: Create an Express Server

Next, let's create an Express server to handle HTTP requests and connect it to our GraphQL schema.

Create a file called `server.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
const schema = require('./schema');

const app = express();

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema,
  graphiql: true,
}));

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

In this code, we import `express` and the `graphqlHTTP` middleware from the `express-graphql` package. We also import our `schema` from the `./schema` file.

We then create an instance of the `express` server, specify a route for handling GraphQL requests (`/graphql`), and pass our `schema` to the `graphqlHTTP` middleware. We set `graphiql` to `true` to enable the GraphiQL interface for testing our GraphQL API.

Finally, we start the server on port 3000 and log a message to the console.

## Step 5: Start the Server

To start the GraphQL server, run the following command in the terminal:

```
node server.js
```

You should see the message "Server running on port 3000" logged to the console, indicating that the server is running successfully.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to set up a JavaScript GraphQL server using Node.js, Express, and the `graphql` package. Now you can start building your GraphQL APIs and enjoy the flexibility and power it offers.
