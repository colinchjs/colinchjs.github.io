Lazy evaluation is a programming technique that delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is actually needed. This can help improve the performance and efficiency of our code by avoiding unnecessary computations.

In JavaScript, lazy evaluation can be accomplished using functions, closures, and the concept of memoization. Let's explore how we can implement lazy evaluation in JavaScript and examine some benchmarks to see the performance benefits.

## Lazy evaluation using functions and closures

```javascript
function lazyEvaluation(fn) {
  let evaluated = false;
  let result;

  return function () {
    if (!evaluated) {
      result = fn();
      evaluated = true;
    }

    return result;
  };
}

// Example usage
const lazyAddition = lazyEvaluation(() => {
  console.log("Performing addition");
  return 5 + 3;
});

console.log(lazyAddition()); // Performing addition, 8
console.log(lazyAddition()); // 8 (result is cached)
```

In this example, we define a `lazyEvaluation` function that takes a function `fn` as a parameter. The returned function encapsulates the evaluation of `fn`. Until the returned function is actually called, the `fn` function is not executed.

Once the returned function is called, it checks if the value has already been evaluated. If not, it computes the value by invoking the provided `fn` function. The result is then stored and returned. On subsequent calls, the cached result is returned without re-evaluating the function.

## Lazy evaluation benchmarks

Now let's compare the performance of lazy evaluation with direct evaluation using some benchmarks. We'll use `console.time` and `console.timeEnd` to measure the execution time of different scenarios.

```javascript
function calculate() {
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= 1000000000; i++) {
    result += i;
  }
  return result;
}

console.time("Direct Evaluation");
console.log(calculate());
console.timeEnd("Direct Evaluation");

const lazyCalculation = lazyEvaluation(calculate);

console.time("Lazy Evaluation");
console.log(lazyCalculation());
console.timeEnd("Lazy Evaluation");
```

In this benchmark, we have a function `calculate` that performs a complex calculation. We measure the execution time of both direct evaluation and lazy evaluation scenarios using the `console.time` and `console.timeEnd` functions.

The results will vary depending on the hardware and browser used, but in general, lazy evaluation should be faster due to the caching of computed results. By avoiding unnecessary computation, lazy evaluation can significantly improve the performance of our code.

## Conclusion

Lazy evaluation is a powerful technique that can improve the performance and efficiency of our JavaScript code. By delaying the evaluation of expressions until they are actually needed, we can avoid unnecessary computations and improve overall resource utilization.

Implementing lazy evaluation in JavaScript is relatively straightforward using functions, closures, and memoization. By caching computed results, we can avoid redundant computations and achieve better performance.
