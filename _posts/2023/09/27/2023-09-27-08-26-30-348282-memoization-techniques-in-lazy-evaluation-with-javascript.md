Lazy evaluation and memoization are two powerful techniques used in programming to optimize the performance of applications by reducing redundant computations. In this blog post, we will explore how these techniques can be combined in JavaScript.

## Understanding Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation is a programming technique where the evaluation of an expression or computation is delayed until its result is actually needed. This can help improve the efficiency of programs by avoiding unnecessary computations.

In JavaScript, lazy evaluation can be achieved using functions and closures. You can create functions that return another function (also known as a closure) which will only be executed when called.

```javascript
function lazyAdd(a, b) {
  return function() {
    console.log("Performing addition...");
    return a + b;
  };
}

const result = lazyAdd(2, 3);
console.log(result()); // Output: Performing addition... 5
```

In the above example, the `lazyAdd` function takes two arguments and returns another function that performs the addition of these arguments. The actual addition is only executed when the returned function is called.

## Understanding Memoization

Memoization is another optimization technique where the results of expensive function calls are cached and reused for subsequent calls with the same inputs. This can significantly speed up computations by avoiding redundant calculations.

In JavaScript, memoization can be implemented using an object or a Map to store the computed results. We can wrap the original function inside another function that checks if the result for a given set of inputs is already cached. If the result is found in the cache, it is returned directly; otherwise, the original function is called and the result is stored in the cache for future use.

```javascript
function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = new Map();
  
  return function(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    
    if (cache.has(key)) {
      console.log("Returning cached result...");
      return cache.get(key);
    }
    
    console.log("Executing expensive computation...");
    const result = fn(...args);
    cache.set(key, result);
    return result;
  };
}

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const memoizedSum = memoize(sum);

console.log(memoizedSum(2, 3)); // Output: Executing expensive computation... 5
console.log(memoizedSum(2, 3)); // Output: Returning cached result... 5
```

In this example, the `memoize` function takes a function `fn` and returns another function that implements the memoization logic. The `cache` object is used to store the results of previous computations. If the result for a given set of inputs is found in the cache, it is returned directly; otherwise, the original function `fn` is called, the result is stored in the cache, and then returned.

## Combining Lazy Evaluation and Memoization

By combining lazy evaluation and memoization, we can further optimize computations in our JavaScript applications. The lazy evaluation technique ensures that computations are only performed when necessary, while memoization prevents redundant computations by reusing cached results.

```javascript
function lazyMemoize(fn) {
  const cache = new Map();
  
  return function(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    
    if (cache.has(key)) {
      console.log("Returning cached result...");
      return cache.get(key);
    }
    
    console.log("Performing expensive computation...");
    const result = fn(...args);
    cache.set(key, result);
    return result;
  };
}

function expensiveComputation(n) {
  console.log("Executing expensive computation...");
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    result += i;
  }
  return result;
}

const lazyMemoizedComputation = lazyMemoize(expensiveComputation);

console.log(lazyMemoizedComputation(5)); // Output: Performing expensive computation... 15
console.log(lazyMemoizedComputation(5)); // Output: Returning cached result... 15
```

In this example, we define a `lazyMemoize` function that combines both lazy evaluation and memoization. The function works similar to the previous memoization example, but it also ensures that the actual computation is only performed when the result is not already cached.

By using lazy evaluation and memoization together, we can optimize the performance of our JavaScript applications by minimizing redundant computations and improving overall efficiency.
