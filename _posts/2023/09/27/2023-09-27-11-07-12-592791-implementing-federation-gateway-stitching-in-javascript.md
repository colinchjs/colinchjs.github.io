The concept of Federation Gateway Stitching refers to the ability to combine multiple GraphQL endpoints or services into a unified API gateway. This allows clients to send queries and mutations to a single endpoint, which then routes the requests to the respective underlying services.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement Federation Gateway Stitching in JavaScript using the popular Apollo Federation library. This approach enables seamless composition and scaling of GraphQL services.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of GraphQL and its concepts
- Familiarity with JavaScript and Node.js

## Getting Started
To get started, we need to set up a new Node.js project and install the required dependencies.

Open your terminal and run the following commands:
```shell
mkdir federation-gateway-stitching
cd federation-gateway-stitching
npm init -y
npm install apollo-server graphql @apollo/federation graphql-tools
```

## Setting up the Gateway
Let's create a new file called `gateway.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  serviceList: [
    { name: 'service1', url: 'https://service1-url.com/graphql' },
    { name: 'service2', url: 'https://service2-url.com/graphql' },
    // Add more services as needed
  ],
});

(async () => {
  await gateway.load();

  const { schema, executor } = gateway;

  // Start the gateway server
  // ...
})();
```

In the code above, we import the `ApolloGateway` from the `@apollo/gateway` package. Then, we create a new instance of `ApolloGateway` with an array of services. Each service has a unique name and its corresponding GraphQL endpoint URL.

When calling `gateway.load()`, Apollo Gateway retrieves the schema from each service and stitches them together into a unified schema.

## Starting the Gateway Server
To start the Apollo Gateway server, we need to add the following code to the end of `gateway.js`:

```javascript
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  executor,
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Gateway Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

The code above creates a new `ApolloServer` instance, passing the `schema` and `executor` from the `gateway` object. Then, it starts the server and logs the server URL to the console.

## Adding Custom Operations
To add custom operations to the gateway, we can define resolvers and additional types.

```javascript
// Example resolvers
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    customOperation: (_, args, context) => {
      // Custom logic here
    },
  },
};

const gatewayServer = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  executor,
  resolvers,
});
```

The `resolvers` object contains resolver functions for custom operations specified in the GraphQL schema.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we learned how to implement Federation Gateway Stitching in JavaScript using the Apollo Federation library. With Federation Gateway Stitching, we can combine multiple GraphQL endpoints into a unified gateway, providing flexibility and scalability to our GraphQL services.
