Caching involves storing the results of a computation so that they can be reused later instead of recalculating them every time they are needed. For lazy evaluation, we can cache the computed values and retrieve them when necessary.

Let's take a look at an example to understand how lazy evaluation with caching can be implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript
const lazySum = (a, b) => {
  let sum;

  return () => {
    if (sum === undefined) {
      console.log('Calculating sum...');
      sum = a + b;
    }

    return sum;
  };
};

const sum = lazySum(5, 3);

console.log(sum()); // Output: Calculating sum... 8
console.log(sum()); // Output: 8 (cached result)
```

In the example above, we define a function `lazySum` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`. Inside `lazySum`, we declare a variable `sum` and assign it the value `undefined`. We then return an anonymous function as the result of `lazySum`.

Whenever the returned function is called (as `sum`), it checks if `sum` is undefined. If it is, it calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and assigns the result to `sum`. If `sum` is already defined, it simply returns the cached result.

When we call `sum()` for the first time, it calculates the sum and logs "Calculating sum..." to the console. However, when we call `sum()` again, it doesn't recalculate the sum but retrieves and returns the cached result.

Using lazy evaluation with caching can improve performance in scenarios where computations are expensive and need to be done only once. It allows us to avoid unnecessary computations and speed up our code execution.
