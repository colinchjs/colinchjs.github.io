## Introduction

Data authorization is a crucial aspect of building secure and reliable applications. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used authorization model that allows you to control access to different resources based on roles assigned to users. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement data authorization with RBAC in a JavaScript GraphQL server.

## What is RBAC?

RBAC is a model that defines roles and permissions for users in an application. It allows you to manage access control by assigning users to different roles, and then granting or denying permissions based on those roles.

In RBAC, there are typically three main components:

1. **Roles**: These represent a collection of permissions and are assigned to users. Examples of roles could be "admin", "editor", or "viewer".

2. **Permissions**: These define what actions a user with a specific role can perform. For example, an "admin" may have permission to create, read, update, and delete resources, while a "viewer" may only have permission to read resources.

3. **Users**: These are the individuals who authenticate and interact with the system. Users are assigned roles, which determine their access to different resources.

## Implementing RBAC in a JavaScript GraphQL server

To implement RBAC in a JavaScript GraphQL server, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define roles and permissions

Start by defining the roles and permissions in your application. Identify the different actions users can perform and group them into meaningful roles. For example:

```javascript
const roles = {
  admin: ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'],
  editor: ['read', 'update'],
  viewer: ['read']
};
```

### Step 2: Assign roles to users

Next, assign roles to users based on their authorization level or any other criteria. You can store this information in your user data or in a separate RBAC database. For example:

```javascript
const users = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'John Doe',
    role: 'admin'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Jane Smith',
    role: 'viewer'
  }
];
```

### Step 3: Validate permissions in GraphQL resolvers

In your GraphQL resolvers, validate the permissions for each request based on the user's role. If the user doesn't have the required permission, you can throw an error or return an appropriate response. For example:

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getUser: (parent, args, context) => {
      const { role } = context.user;
      
      if (!roles[role].includes('read')) {
        throw new Error('Unauthorized access');
      }
      
      // Fetch and return the user data
      ...
    }
  },
  Mutation: {
    createUser: (parent, args, context) => {
      const { role } = context.user;
      
      if (!roles[role].includes('create')) {
        throw new Error('Unauthorized access');
      }
      
      // Create and return the user data
      ...
    }
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Authenticate and authorize users

Before executing any GraphQL operation, authenticate and authorize the user. This can be done using authentication middleware or by validating a JWT token. Once authenticated, set the user object in the context, which can be accessed by the resolvers. For example:

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  context: ({ req }) => {
    const token = req.headers.authorization;
    const user = authenticate(token);
    
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error('Unauthorized user');
    }
    
    return {
      user
    };
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

Implementing RBAC in a JavaScript GraphQL server adds an additional layer of security to your application. By defining roles and permissions, assigning roles to users, and validating permissions in your resolvers, you can control access to data and ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions. Remember to always follow best practices when implementing authorization and regularly review and update your RBAC configuration as your application evolves.
