Lazy evaluation is a powerful technique in programming that allows computation or execution to be deferred until the result is actually needed. This can be particularly useful when dealing with potentially expensive or time-consuming operations.

In JavaScript, lazy evaluation can be implemented using functions and closures. The basic idea is to wrap the computation or operation in a function and return a closure that can be called later to actually perform the computation. This way, the computation is only done when the closure is invoked.

Let's take a look at an example of implementing lazy evaluation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function lazyOperation() {
  let computedResult; // store the computed result

  return function() {
    if (!computedResult) {
      // perform the expensive operation
      computedResult = /* code to compute the result */;
    }

    return computedResult;
  }
}

// Usage
const lazyResult = lazyOperation();

// The expensive operation is not performed until the result is actually needed
console.log(lazyResult()); // This triggers the computation and returns the result
```

In the above example, the `lazyOperation` function creates a closure that performs the expensive operation only if the `computedResult` has not been calculated yet. Subsequent calls to the closure return the cached result.

By using lazy evaluation, we can optimize our code by deferring computations until they are actually needed, avoiding unnecessary work and improving performance.

## Generating Lazy Evaluation Documentation

When documenting code that utilizes lazy evaluation, it's important to highlight the lazy nature of the computation. Here's an example of how to document lazy evaluation in markdown format:

```markdown
### Lazy Evaluation with `lazyOperation()`
`lazyOperation()` is a function that enables lazy evaluation in JavaScript. It returns a closure that performs a computation only when invoked. Here's how to use it:

```javascript
const lazyResult = lazyOperation();

// The expensive operation is not performed until the result is actually needed
console.log(lazyResult()); // This triggers the computation and returns the result
```

By using `lazyOperation()`, we can optimize our code by deferring computations until they are required, resulting in improved performance.
```

Remember to adapt this code snippet and documentation to your specific use case.
