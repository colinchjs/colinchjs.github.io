In today's tech-driven world, security is of utmost importance when it comes to building web applications. One popular method of securing a JavaScript GraphQL server is by using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## What is JWT?

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are an industry-standard method for representing claims securely between two parties. They consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. 

The header typically contains information about the type of token and the cryptographic algorithm used to secure it. The payload contains the claims or assertions made about the user or application. The signature ensures the integrity of the token and can verify that it hasn't been tampered with.

## JWT Authentication in a JavaScript GraphQL Server

To secure a JavaScript GraphQL server with JWT authentication, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Generate JWT upon successful user authentication

When a user provides valid credentials and is authenticated, generate a JWT token on the server. Include relevant user information in the payload, such as their user ID or roles.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Generate JWT token
const generateToken = (user) => {
  const payload = {
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    // Add any other relevant user information
  };

  const token = jwt.sign(payload, 'your_secret_key', { expiresIn: '1h' });

  return token;
};
```

### 2. Include JWT in the authorization header for protected GraphQL queries or mutations

When making GraphQL queries or mutations to protected endpoints, include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header. The token is typically prefixed with the word "Bearer" to indicate the token type.

```javascript
// Make a request to the GraphQL server with authorization header
const protectedQuery = async () => {
  const token = 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MTEyMzQ1Njc4OSwiZW1haWwiOiJhZG1pbkBleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTYzNDE5MTM4OSwiZXhwIjoxNjM0MTk1Mzg5fQ.oEfv3_hx855LHELfAdH3qHPHRrIwNnn3rLj9IObn9jc';

  const response = await fetch('/graphql', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': token,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query: '{ protectedQuery }' }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  // Handle response data
};
```

### 3. Verify and decode JWT on the server

On the server-side, verify the JWT token's signature and decode the payload to retrieve user information. Ensure that the token hasn't expired and perform any additional authorization checks based on the user's claims.

```javascript
const verifyAndDecodeToken = (token) => {
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'your_secret_key');
    return decoded;
  } catch (err) {
    // Token is invalid or expired
    throw new Error('Invalid token');
  }
};
```

By implementing JWT authentication in your JavaScript GraphQL server, you can secure your endpoints and ensure that only authorized users can access protected resources.
