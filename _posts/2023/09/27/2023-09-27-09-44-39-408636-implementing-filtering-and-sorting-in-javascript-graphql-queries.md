GraphQL is a powerful query language that allows you to define the shape of your data in a flexible and efficient way. One of the key features of GraphQL is the ability to filter and sort data directly in your queries. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement filtering and sorting in JavaScript GraphQL queries.

## Filtering

Filtering allows you to retrieve only the data that meets specific criteria. With GraphQL, you can define filter arguments in your query, which will be used to filter the data on the server side. Here's an example of how to implement filtering in a GraphQL query using JavaScript:

```javascript
const gql = require('graphql-tag');

const GET_USERS = gql`
  query getUsers($name: String!) {
    users(filter: { name: $name }) {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
`;

const name = 'John';

// Execute the query with filter argument
client.query({
  query: GET_USERS,
  variables: { name },
})
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result.data.users);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In the above example, we define a GraphQL query `getUsers` that takes a `name` argument. We use this argument to filter the `users` data by name. We then execute the query using a GraphQL client, providing the `name` variable in the `variables` object.

## Sorting

Sorting allows you to retrieve data in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. GraphQL provides built-in support for sorting by specifying the field and the order (ASC or DESC). Here's an example of how to implement sorting in a GraphQL query using JavaScript:

```javascript
const gql = require('graphql-tag');

const GET_USERS = gql`
  query getUsers($orderBy: UserOrderByInput!) {
    users(orderBy: $orderBy) {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
`;

const orderBy = {
  field: 'name',
  order: 'DESC',
};

// Execute the query with orderBy argument
client.query({
  query: GET_USERS,
  variables: { orderBy },
})
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result.data.users);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In the above example, we define a GraphQL query `getUsers` that takes an `orderBy` argument of type `UserOrderByInput`. We specify the field and order in the `orderBy` object and pass it as a variable to the query.

## Conclusion

Filtering and sorting are essential features when working with data. With GraphQL, you can easily implement filtering and sorting in your JavaScript queries by defining arguments in your GraphQL schema and passing variables in your queries. This allows for more efficient and flexible data retrieval.
