Lazy evaluation is a programming technique where the evaluation of an expression or a function is delayed until its value is actually needed. This can be particularly useful when working with large data sets or computationally expensive operations. 

In JavaScript, we can implement lazy evaluation using generators. Generators are functions that can be exited and later re-entered, allowing us to pause and resume their execution. They are defined using the `function*` syntax and yield values using the `yield` keyword.

Let's see an example of implementing lazy evaluation using generators:

```javascript
function* lazyFilter(arr, predicate) {
  for (let item of arr) {
    if (predicate(item)) {
      yield item;
    }
  }
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const filteredNumbers = lazyFilter(numbers, num => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(filteredNumbers.next().value); // output: 2
console.log(filteredNumbers.next().value); // output: 4
```

In the above code, we define a generator function `lazyFilter` that takes an array `arr` and a `predicate` function as input. It iterates over each item in the array and yields only those items for which the `predicate` function returns `true`.

We then create an array of numbers and use `lazyFilter` to filter out only the even numbers. We can lazily evaluate the filtered numbers by calling `filteredNumbers.next()` which returns an iterator result object. We can access the filtered values using the `value` property of the iterator result.

With lazy evaluation using generators, we can avoid unnecessary computations and only compute values when required. This can lead to improved performance, especially when working with large data sets or complex operations.

By implementing lazy evaluation in JavaScript with generators, we can write more efficient and scalable code, making our programs more optimized and improving overall execution speed.
