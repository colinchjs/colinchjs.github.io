In JavaScript, the Lazy.js library provides a convenient way to implement lazy evaluation. It is a popular library that allows us to work with collections in a lazy manner, reducing the need to load all the data into memory upfront.

To get started with Lazy.js, we first need to include the library in our project. We can either download it manually from the Lazy.js GitHub repository or install it through a package manager like npm.

Once we have the library included, we can start using lazy evaluation in our code. Let's take a look at an example to see how it works:

```javascript
const Lazy = require('lazy.js');

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = Lazy(numbers)
  .map(x => {
    console.log(`Doubling ${x}`);
    return x * 2;
  });

console.log(doubledNumbers.take(3).toArray());
```

In the above code, we create a lazy sequence using the `Lazy()` function and pass in an array of numbers. We then chain the `map()` function to double each number in the sequence. Notice that the actual doubling computation is only performed when the sequence is consumed, which happens when we call `toArray()`.

Lazy.js also provides a variety of other functions to perform operations on lazy sequences, such as `filter()`, `take()`, `drop()`, and many more. These functions allow us to apply transformations and filters to the sequence without actually executing any loops or calculations until necessary.

By utilizing lazy evaluation with Lazy.js, we can enhance the efficiency of our code by deferring expensive computations until they are actually required. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex algorithms.
