In a GraphQL server, it's important to have measures in place to prevent abuse and ensure the stability and performance of the system. One common technique is request rate limiting, where the number of requests made by a client is limited within a certain time frame.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement request rate limiting in a Javascript GraphQL server using the `express-rate-limit` package. This package allows us to easily set up rate limiting middleware for our server.

## Step 1: Install the `express-rate-limit` package

To get started, let's install the `express-rate-limit` package from NPM. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
npm install express-rate-limit
```

## Step 2: Setup rate limiting middleware

Next, we need to set up the rate limiting middleware in our GraphQL server. In your server file, import the `express-rate-limit` package and create a rate limiting middleware:

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // maximum of 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use('/graphql', limiter);
```

In the code above, we create a rate limiter that allows a maximum of 100 requests per 15 minutes for the `/graphql` route. You can adjust these values based on your specific requirements.

## Step 3: Handle rate limit exceeded

When a client exceeds the rate limit, we can customize the response by adding an error handler using the `express-rate-limit` package. Add the following code after setting up the rate limiting middleware:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  if (err instanceof rateLimit.RateLimitExceeded) {
    // Handle rate limit exceeded
    res.status(429).json({ error: 'Rate limit exceeded' });
  } else {
    next(err);
  }
});
```

In the code above, we check if the error is an instance of `rateLimit.RateLimitExceeded` and handle it by returning a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code with a JSON response indicating the rate limit has been exceeded.

## Conclusion

Implementing request rate limiting in a Javascript GraphQL server is crucial for preventing abuse and maintaining system stability. By using the `express-rate-limit` package, we can easily set up rate limiting middleware and customize the response when the rate limit is exceeded.

Remember to adjust the rate limit values based on your specific requirements and traffic patterns. This ensures that your GraphQL server is well-protected and able to handle requests efficiently.
