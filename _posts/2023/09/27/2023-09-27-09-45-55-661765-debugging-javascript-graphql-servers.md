When developing and maintaining GraphQL servers in Javascript, it is important to have effective debugging techniques in place. This will help identify and resolve any issues that may arise during development or in a production environment. In this blog post, we will explore some best practices for debugging Javascript GraphQL servers.

## 1. Logging and Error Handling

Proper logging and error handling are crucial for debugging GraphQL servers. By logging relevant information at various points in your code, you can gain insights into the flow and state of your application. Additionally, make sure to catch and handle errors appropriately, providing meaningful error messages to aid in troubleshooting.

```javascript
try {
  // Your GraphQL server code here
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  throw new Error('An error occurred while processing the GraphQL request.');
}
```

## 2. Using Debugging Tools

There are several helpful tools available for debugging GraphQL servers in Javascript. One such tool is [Apollo Server Debugger](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server#debugging). It provides an intuitive way to debug your GraphQL server by allowing you to explore the GraphQL schema, execute queries, and view resolver execution details.

Here is an example of how to enable the debugger in Apollo Server:

```javascript
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground } = require('apollo-server-core');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  // Your schema and resolvers here
  plugins: [ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground({})],
  debug: true, // Enable debugger
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

## Conclusion

Debugging GraphQL servers in Javascript can be made easier and more efficient by following these best practices. By implementing proper logging and error handling, and utilizing debugging tools like Apollo Server Debugger, you can quickly identify and resolve issues, ensuring a smooth and reliable GraphQL server implementation.

Remember to use these techniques to improve your debugging process and maintain a high-quality GraphQL server, providing a seamless experience for your users.
