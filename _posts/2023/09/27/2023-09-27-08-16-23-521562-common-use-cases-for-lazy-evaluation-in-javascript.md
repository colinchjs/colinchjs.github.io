## 1. Conditional Rendering

Lazy evaluation can be employed in conditional rendering scenarios, where we want to render a component or execute a function only when certain conditions are met. Instead of immediately rendering or executing the code, lazy evaluation delays the execution until the condition is satisfied.

For example, consider a web application where a certain component should only be displayed when a user is authenticated. By using lazy evaluation, we can defer the rendering of the component until the user's authentication status is confirmed. This can help improve performance by avoiding unnecessary rendering and execution.

```javascript
if (isAuthenticated) {
  lazyRender(component);
}
```

## 2. Deferred Computations

Lazy evaluation is also handy when dealing with expensive or time-consuming computations. Instead of eagerly calculating the results, lazy evaluation allows us to defer the computation until the last possible moment, when the result is absolutely needed.

Suppose we have a function that performs a complex mathematical operation, which is only required under certain conditions. By using lazy evaluation, we can delay the execution of the function until the specific condition is met.

```javascript
function computeComplexOperation() {
  // Expensive computation..
}

// Lazy evaluation example
const result = shouldCompute ? computeComplexOperation() : null;
```

In this example, the `computeComplexOperation` function will only be called if the `shouldCompute` variable evaluates to `true`. Otherwise, the result will be set to `null` without the expensive computation being performed.

These are just a few examples of how lazy evaluation can be beneficial in JavaScript. Whether it's for optimizing performance, improving efficiency, or deferring computationally expensive tasks, lazy evaluation is a valuable technique to have in your programming toolkit.

## Conclusion

Lazy evaluation presents a powerful approach to tackle conditional rendering and deferred computations in JavaScript. By deferring the execution until necessary, we can optimize the code performance and improve efficiency. Understanding and utilizing lazy evaluation can greatly enhance your programming skills and help you write more efficient and maintainable code.
