## 1. Debugging with console logs

One of the simplest yet effective techniques for debugging Immer-powered applications is to use console logs strategically. By logging relevant information at different stages of your code, you can gain insights into the state transformations and pinpoint any unexpected behavior.

```javascript
import produce from 'immer';

const originalState = {
  count: 0,
};

const updatedState = produce(originalState, (draftState) => {
  draftState.count += 1;
});

console.log(updatedState);
```

By logging the `updatedState` in the above example, you can quickly check if the state mutation is happening as expected. You can place console logs at different stages within your Immer-related code to track and validate state changes at each step.

## 2. Immer Devtools

Immer Devtools is a useful browser extension that allows you to inspect and debug your Immer-powered application's state. It provides a visual interface to navigate through the state history and track the changes made to your state over time.

To use Immer Devtools, follow these steps:

1. Install the extension from the Chrome or Firefox web store.
2. Start your application and open the developer tools in your browser.
3. Navigate to the "Immer" tab within the developer tools.
4. Enable the "Record" button to start recording state changes.

Once recording is enabled, any state changes made using Immer will be captured and displayed in the Immer Devtools panel. You can navigate through the recorded history, inspect individual state snapshots, and compare the differences between them. This visual representation can be invaluable in identifying unexpected state mutations or problematic code patterns.

## Conclusion

Debugging Immer-powered applications doesn't have to be overwhelming. By utilizing console logs strategically and leveraging tools like Immer Devtools, you can quickly identify and resolve issues in your codebase. Remember to systematically track state changes, log relevant information, and leverage developer tools whenever necessary. With these techniques in your debugging arsenal, you'll be able to ensure the smooth operation of your Immer-powered applications.
