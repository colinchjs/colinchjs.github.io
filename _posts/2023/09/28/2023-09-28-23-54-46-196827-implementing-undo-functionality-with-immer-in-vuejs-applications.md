Undo functionality is a common requirement in many applications. It allows users to revert changes they have made, providing a safety net and a better user experience. In Vue.js applications, we can implement undo functionality with the help of Immer, a popular library for immutable state management.

## What is Immer?

Immer is a library that allows you to work with immutable state by creating a draft of the state and applying changes to it. It simplifies the process of updating nested state structures without mutating the original objects.

## Setting up Immer in a Vue.js application

To get started, let's install Immer:

```shell
npm install immer
```

Next, import the `produce` function from the Immer library:

```javascript
import { produce } from 'immer';
```

## Implementing undo functionality

To implement undo functionality with Immer in Vue.js, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a state object

First, create a state object that represents the data you want to keep track of:

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    todos: [],
    undoStack: [],
    redoStack: [],
  };
},
```

Here, we have a `todos` array that represents a list of tasks, as well as `undoStack` and `redoStack` arrays to store the history of the state.

### 2. Update state using Immer's `produce` function

Whenever you make changes to the state, use Immer's `produce` function to create a draft of the state and apply the changes:

```javascript
this.todos = produce(this.todos, (draft) => {
  draft.push('New task');
});
```

In this example, we add a new task to the `todos` array. Immer's `produce` function ensures that the original `todos` array remains unmutated.

### 3. Implement undo and redo functionality

To enable undo functionality, we need to add the current state to the `undoStack` whenever there is a change:

```javascript
this.undoStack.push(this.todos);
```

To undo a change, we can retrieve the previous state from the `undoStack` and update the current state:

```javascript
undo() {
  if (this.undoStack.length) {
    const prevState = this.undoStack.pop();
    this.redoStack.push(this.todos);
    this.todos = prevState;
  }
}
```

Similarly, to redo a change, we retrieve the next state from the `redoStack` and update the current state:

```javascript
redo() {
  if (this.redoStack.length) {
    const nextState = this.redoStack.pop();
    this.undoStack.push(this.todos);
    this.todos = nextState;
  }
}
```

By maintaining the stacks and updating the state accordingly, we can implement undo and redo functionality in our Vue.js application.

## Conclusion

By using Immer in Vue.js applications, we can easily implement undo functionality without worrying about mutating the state. Immer's `produce` function allows us to work with immutable state in a simple and intuitive way. By maintaining undo and redo stacks, we can provide users with the ability to revert changes and improve the overall user experience.
