While Immer offers great convenience and productivity, it's important to consider performance optimizations when working with large data structures. Here are some tips for optimizing Immer usage to improve performance:

1. **Use `produce` sparingly**: The `produce` function is the heart of Immer and is used to create and modify immutable data. While it's a powerful tool, it is recommended to use it only where necessary. Frequent use of `produce` can introduce performance overhead, especially when working with large data structures. Identify specific areas of your codebase where immutability is required and apply `produce` only in those cases.

2. **Minimize use of `immerable` decorator**: The `immerable` decorator is used to mark objects as "immerable", allowing Immer to track and make them immutable. Although convenient, excessive use of `immerable` can impact performance. Consider adding the `immerable` decorator only on objects that require immutability enforcement, rather than applying it to all objects by default.

3. **Avoid unnecessary nesting**: Immer allows for nested immutability, meaning you can apply `produce` in a nested manner to create or modify data. However, excessive nesting can lead to reduced performance. Instead, strive for shallow immutability where possible. This can be achieved by decomposing complex data structures into smaller, more manageable parts, reducing the need for deep nesting.

4. **Leverage batching**: Immer offers a batching mechanism that allows you to group multiple state modifications into a single transaction. This can greatly improve performance when making multiple changes to an immutable state. Use the `immer.enableBatching()` and `immer.disableBatching()` functions to wrap multiple `produce` calls within a single batch and enable batching where appropriate.

5. **Consider using custom comparators**: By default, Immer uses a shallow equality check to determine if a data structure has changed. However, in certain scenarios, a custom comparator function can provide more fine-grained control over the equality check, leading to potential optimizations. You can implement a custom comparator using `immer.useProxies()` or `immer.setAutoFreeze()` depending on your specific needs.

By keeping these optimization tips in mind, you can ensure that your usage of Immer remains performant even when working with large and complex data structures. Happy immutability programming!
