## Introduction

In modern JavaScript applications, managing state is a crucial task. Immer is a powerful library that can simplify this process by allowing us to create immutable state objects with ease. In this blog post, we will explore how to create immutable state objects using Immer.

## What is Immer?

Immer is a JavaScript library that enables us to work with immutable state by introducing a concept called "drafts". With Immer, we can make changes to a draft object that represent the next state of our application. Immer takes care of creating a new immutable state object based on the changes we make to the draft.

## Installation

To get started with Immer, we need to install it as a dependency. You can install Immer using npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install immer
```

or

```shell
yarn add immer
```

## Creating an immutable state object

We can create an immutable state object using Immer by following these steps:

1. Import the `produce` function from the Immer library.
2. Define an initial state object.
3. Use the `produce` function to create a draft of the state object and make changes to it.
4. Access the next state using the `draft` parameter inside the `produce` callback function.
5. Immer will automatically create a new immutable state based on the changes made to the draft.
6. Use the updated state object for further operations.

Here's an example of how we can create an immutable state object using Immer:

```javascript
const { produce } = require('immer');

const initialState = {
  counter: 0,
};

const nextState = produce(initialState, draft => {
  draft.counter += 1;
});

console.log(nextState);
```

In the example above, we import the `produce` function from the Immer library. Then, we define an initial state object with a `counter` property. We use the `produce` function to create a draft of the state object and increment the `counter` by one. Finally, Immer automatically creates a new immutable state object based on the changes made to the draft.

## Conclusion

Immer simplifies the process of creating immutable state objects in JavaScript applications. It allows us to work with drafts and automatically creates new immutable state objects based on the changes made to the drafts. By using Immer, we can write more maintainable and bug-free code.
