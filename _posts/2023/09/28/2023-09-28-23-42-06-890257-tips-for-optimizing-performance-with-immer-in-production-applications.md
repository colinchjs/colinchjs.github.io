Immer is a powerful library that simplifies state management by allowing developers to work with immutable data structures in a more intuitive way. It is widely used in many JavaScript applications to handle complex state updates. While Immer provides a convenient API and encourages a more functional programming style, it is important to ensure optimal performance when using it in production applications. In this blog post, we will explore some tips for optimizing performance with Immer.

## 1. Use `produce` function sparingly

Immer provides the `produce` function to create a draft state and apply updates to it immutably. While it is convenient to use `produce` for every state update, it can lead to unnecessary calculations and performance overhead. It is recommended to use `produce` only when you need to make deep changes to a state object.

If you are making shallow updates to a state object, consider using the `immer` object directly. This will skip the draft creation process and offer better performance. For example, instead of using:

```javascript
const nextState = produce(prevState, (draft) => {
  draft.someProperty = newValue;
});
```

You can directly mutate the object using:

```javascript
immerObj.someProperty = newValue;
const nextState = immerObj;
```

## 2. Use the `isDraft` function for conditional updates

In some cases, you may need to have conditional updates based on the state properties. Immer provides the `isDraft` function that allows you to check if a given value is a draft state. This can be useful to avoid unnecessary immutability checks and increase performance.

Instead of using:

```javascript
const nextState = produce(prevState, (draft) => {
  if (!Array.isArray(draft.someArray)) {
    draft.someArray = [];
  }
  draft.someArray.push(newValue);
});
```

You can leverage the `isDraft` function to optimize the conditional update:

```javascript
const nextState = produce(prevState, (draft) => {
  if (!isDraft(draft.someArray)) {
    draft.someArray = [];
  }
  draft.someArray.push(newValue);
});
```

## Conclusion

Immer is a powerful library that enhances state management in JavaScript applications. By considering these optimization tips, you can ensure better performance when using Immer in your production applications. Remember to use the `produce` function sparingly and leverage the `isDraft` function for conditional updates. Happy coding!
