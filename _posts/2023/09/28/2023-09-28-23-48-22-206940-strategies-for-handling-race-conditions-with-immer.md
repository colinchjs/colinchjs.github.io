Race conditions occur when multiple threads or processes access shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable and erroneous behavior. Immer is a state management library for JavaScript that helps in managing immutable data structures. In this blog post, we will explore some strategies for handling race conditions with Immer.

### 1. Use Immer's built-in produceWithPatches

Immer provides a `produceWithPatches` function that returns not only the next state but also an array of "patches" describing the changes made to the state. These patches can be used to keep track of the changes made during the state update. By leveraging these patches, you can handle race conditions more effectively.

```javascript
import produceWithPatches from 'immer';

const [nextState, patches] = produceWithPatches(currentState, (draftState) => {
  // Update the draftState here
});

// Apply the patches to the currentState
applyPatches(currentState, patches);
```

By applying the patches to the current state after the state update, you can ensure that any concurrent modifications are correctly accounted for and applied.

### 2. Use Immer's "curried" producer functions

Immer allows you to create "curried" producer functions that can be reused across multiple state updates. This can be helpful in handling race conditions, as you can ensure that each state update is executed sequentially.

```javascript
import produce from 'immer';

// Create a curried producer function
const updateState = produce((draftState, payload) => {
  // Update the draftState based on the payload
});

// Use the curried producer function for state updates
const nextState = updateState(currentState, payload);
```

By using a curried producer function, you ensure that each state update is applied one after the other, avoiding any potential race conditions that may arise when multiple updates happen concurrently.

### Conclusion

Handling race conditions is essential to ensure the consistency and correctness of your application's state. By leveraging the features provided by Immer, such as `produceWithPatches` and "curried" producer functions, you can minimize the risk of race conditions and create more reliable and predictable code.
