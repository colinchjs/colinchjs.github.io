In today's blog post, we will explore how to integrate Immer, a powerful immutable state management library, into a MobX project. Immer provides an elegant way to work with immutable data structures and simplifies the process of managing complex application states. MobX, on the other hand, is a popular library for state management with observable objects, allowing you to track state changes and automatically update the UI.

## Why combine Immer with MobX?

Integrating Immer with MobX can bring a lot of benefits to your project. Here are a few reasons why you might consider using both libraries together:

1. **Simplified state updates**: Immer's `produce` function allows you to update your state in a mutable way while still ensuring immutability. This can greatly simplify the process of updating MobX observable objects, reducing boilerplate code and improving code readability.
2. **Improved performance**: Immer uses a copy-on-write mechanism, which means it only creates new copies of the state objects if they have been modified. This can lead to improved performance by avoiding unnecessary object cloning.
3. **Time-travel debugging**: By using Immer, you can easily implement time-travel debugging in your MobX application. Immer's `produceWithPatches` function provides the ability to track changes made to the state over time, enabling powerful debugging capabilities.

## Integrating Immer into a MobX project

To integrate Immer into your MobX project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install the required dependencies

Start by installing the necessary dependencies. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory:

```bash
npm install mobx immer
```

### Step 2: Create a MobX store

Create a MobX store using the `@observable` decorator to define the state properties we want to make observable:

```javascript
import { observable } from "mobx";

class MyStore {
  @observable data = {
    counter: 0,
    todos: [],
  };
}

const store = new MyStore();
export default store;
```

### Step 3: Update MobX state using Immer

Now we can start using Immer to update our MobX state. Import the `produce` function from Immer and use it to create a new state draft inside MobX actions:

```javascript
import { observable, action } from "mobx";
import produce from "immer";

class MyStore {
  @observable data = {
    counter: 0,
    todos: [],
  };

  @action
  updateData() {
    this.data = produce(this.data, (draft) => {
      draft.counter++;
      draft.todos.push("New todo");
    });
  }
}

const store = new MyStore();
export default store;
```

In the above code, we have used the `@action` decorator from MobX to create an action method called `updateData`. Inside this method, we call `produce` and pass the current state (`this.data`) and a draft function. The draft function is where you can make changes to the state in a mutable way.

### Step 4: Accessing state changes from MobX

If you want to access the state changes from MobX, such as tracking the patches or logging state modifications, you can use Immer's `produceWithPatches` function:

```javascript
import { observable, action } from "mobx";
import produce, { produceWithPatches } from "immer";

// ...

class MyStore {
  // ...

  @action
  updateData() {
    const [newData, patches] = produceWithPatches(this.data, (draft) => {
      draft.counter++;
      draft.todos.push("New todo");
    });

    console.log(patches);
    this.data = newData;
  }
}

// ...
```

In the updated code snippet, we capture the produced `newData` and `patches` from the `produceWithPatches` function. You can then log the patches or perform any custom logic based on the changes.

## Conclusion

By combining Immer with MobX, we can simplify our state updates and benefit from the best of both libraries. Immer allows us to work with immutable data structures in a mutable way, while MobX tracks these changes and updates the UI automatically. This integration brings improved performance and enables powerful debugging capabilities in our MobX projects. Give it a try in your next project and experience the ease of managing complex application states!
