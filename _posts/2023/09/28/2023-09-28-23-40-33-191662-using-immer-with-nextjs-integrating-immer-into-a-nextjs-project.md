In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) into a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, leveraging its powerful features for immutable state management. Immer is a popular library that allows us to work with immutable state in a more intuitive and efficient way.

## Why use Immer?

Immer simplifies the process of working with immutable data structures. It provides a convenient API for creating copies of immutable state without the need for manual deep-cloning or mutation tracking. With Immer, you can write simpler and more readable code while ensuring the integrity of your application's state.

## Integrating Immer into a Next.js project

To start using Immer in a Next.js project, follow the steps below:

1. **Install Immer**: Begin by installing Immer as a dependency in your project. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install immer
   ```

2. **Create a `useImmer` Hook**: Next, let's create a custom React Hook that wraps Immer's functionality. In a new file, let's call it `useImmer.js`, add the following code:

   ```javascript
   import { useState } from 'react';
   import produce from 'immer';

   function useImmer(initialState) {
     const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

     const updateState = (updater) => {
       setState((prevState) => produce(prevState, updater));
     };

     return [state, updateState];
   }

   export default useImmer;
   ```

   This custom Hook, `useImmer`, takes an initial state value and returns an array with two elements: the current state and a function to update it. When the `updateState` function is invoked, Immer's `produce` function is used to create a new immutable state based on the previous state and the provided update function.

3. **Integrate with Next.js**: With the `useImmer` Hook in place, we can now integrate it into our Next.js project. Open one of your Next.js components and import the `useImmer` Hook as follows:

   ```javascript
   import useImmer from '../path/to/useImmer';
   ```

4. **Using `useImmer` in your component**: Finally, to use the `useImmer` Hook in your components, declare a state variable using destructuring assignment, like this:

   ```javascript
   const [state, updateState] = useImmer(initialState);
   ```

   Now you can use `state` as your immutable state variable and `updateState` to modify it. Any changes made using `updateState` will automatically create a new immutable state, avoiding any inadvertent state mutation.

## Conclusion

Integrating Immer into a Next.js project can greatly simplify the management of immutable state. By using Immer's easy-to-use API, you can write more readable and maintainable code while ensuring the integrity of your application's state.
