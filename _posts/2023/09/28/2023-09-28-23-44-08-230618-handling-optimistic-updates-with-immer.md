One popular library that simplifies state management and makes handling optimistic updates easier is Immer. Immer is a JavaScript library that allows you to work with immutable data by making it easy to create a new copy of a state object with desired changes.

To handle optimistic updates with Immer, follow these steps:

1. Install the Immer library in your project by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install immer
   ```

2. Import the `produce` function from Immer into your code:
   ```javascript
   import produce from 'immer';
   ```

3. Set up your initial state object:
   ```javascript
   const initialState = {
     isLoading: false,
     data: [],
   };
   ```

4. Create a function that handles the state update using Immer's `produce` function:
   ```javascript
   const handleOptimisticUpdate = (state, newData) => {
     return produce(state, draft => {
       draft.isLoading = true;
       draft.data.push(newData);
     });
   };
   ```

   In this example, we assume that `newData` is the updated data we want to add to the `data` array, and we set `isLoading` to true to display a loading indicator.

5. Use the `handleOptimisticUpdate` function to update the state:
   ```javascript
   const updatedState = handleOptimisticUpdate(initialState, { id: 1, name: 'John' });
   ```

   This will create a new copy of the state object with the updates performed inside the `produce` block.

By using Immer's `produce` function, you can easily handle optimistic updates in your application's state. Immer simplifies the process of working with immutable data by abstracting away the complexity of creating new copies of state objects, making your code more readable and maintainable.
