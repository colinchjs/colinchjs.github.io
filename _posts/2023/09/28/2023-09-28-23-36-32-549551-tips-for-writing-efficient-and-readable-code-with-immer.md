Writing clean, efficient, and readable code is crucial for the maintainability and scalability of any software project. Immer is a powerful library that helps developers manage immutable state in a more ergonomic and efficient way. In this blog post, we will explore some useful tips for writing efficient and readable code with Immer.

## 1. Use the `produce` function for complex updates

Immer provides a `produce` function that allows you to apply immutable updates to a draft state. This function takes a function as an argument and provides a mutable draft of the original state within that function. You can make any changes to the draft state as you would with mutable data, and Immer will produce a new immutable state based on these changes.

```javascript
import produce from 'immer';

const state = {
  counter: 0,
  users: [],
};

const newState = produce(state, draft => {
  draft.counter += 1;
  draft.users.push({ name: 'John' });
});

console.log(newState);
```

Using the `produce` function instead of manual immutable updates not only makes the code more readable but also helps improve performance by minimizing unnecessary object cloning.

## 2. Apply updates in a single immer call

When working with Immer, it's best to apply updates in a single `produce` call whenever possible. This ensures that Immer can optimize the immutable updates and minimize unnecessary object cloning. Applying updates within nested `produce` calls can lead to unnecessary performance overhead.

```javascript
import produce from 'immer';

const state = {
  todos: [
    { id: 1, text: 'Buy groceries', completed: false },
    { id: 2, text: 'Clean the house', completed: true },
  ],
};

// Good: apply updates in a single immer call
const newState = produce(state, draft => {
  draft.todos[0].completed = true;
  // more updates...
});

// Avoid: applying updates within nested produce calls
const updatedState = produce(state, draft => {
  produce(draft.todos[0], todo => {
    todo.completed = true;
  });
  // more updates...
});
```

By applying updates in a single Immer call, the library can optimize the immutability updates and improve performance.

## Conclusion

Immer is a powerful library for managing immutable state in a more efficient and readable way. By following these tips, you can write cleaner and more performant code with Immer. Remember to use the `produce` function for complex updates and apply updates in a single immer call whenever possible. Happy coding!
