When building web applications, it is often necessary to track when an element receives or loses focus. This can be achieved using the `focus` and `blur` events in JavaScript.

## Adding a Focus Event Listener

To add a focus event listener to an element, you can use the `addEventListener` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
const inputElement = document.getElementById('myInput');

inputElement.addEventListener('focus', function() {
    console.log("Input focused");
});
```

In the code above, we first select the desired input element using `getElementById()`. We then add a focus event listener to the input element, which listens for the `focus` event. When the input receives focus, the function inside the event listener will be executed, which in this case logs a message to the console.

## Adding a Blur Event Listener

Similarly, to add a blur event listener to an element, we can use the `addEventListener` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
const inputElement = document.getElementById('myInput');

inputElement.addEventListener('blur', function() {
    console.log("Input blurred");
});
```

In this code snippet, we select the input element and attach a blur event listener using `addEventListener`. When the input element loses focus (i.e., the user clicks outside the input or moves focus to another element), the function inside the event listener will be executed, logging a message to the console.

## Use Cases

The focus and blur events can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as:

- Validating user input when they move the focus away from an input field.
- Implementing custom styling or animations for focused elements.
- Enhancing accessibility by providing audio or visual feedback when an element receives or loses focus.
