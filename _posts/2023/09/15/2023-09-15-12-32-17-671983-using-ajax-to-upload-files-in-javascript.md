Uploading files from a client's machine to a web server is a common functionality in web applications. Traditionally, this was done using HTML forms and server-side technologies like PHP or ASP.NET. However, with the advancements in JavaScript and the introduction of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), file uploads can now be handled asynchronously without the need to refresh the entire page.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use AJAX to enable file uploads in JavaScript.

## Step 1: HTML Markup

Let's start by creating a simple HTML form to allow users to select a file for uploading.

```html
<form id="uploadForm" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" id="fileInput" name="file" />
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

## Step 2: JavaScript Code

Next, we need to write JavaScript code to handle the form submission using AJAX.

```javascript
document.getElementById("uploadForm").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form from submitting traditionally
  
  var fileInput = document.getElementById("fileInput");
  var file = fileInput.files[0];
  
  var formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("file", file);
  
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  
  xhr.open("POST", "/upload", true); // Replace "/upload" with your server-side upload endpoint
  
  xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
      // File uploaded successfully
      console.log(xhr.responseText);
    }
  };
  
  xhr.send(formData);
});
```

## Step 3: Server-side Implementation

The next step is to handle the file upload on the server side. The implementation of this step depends on your server-side technology of choice. Here's an example using Node.js and Express:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const multer = require("multer");

const app = express();
const upload = multer({ dest: "uploads/" });

app.post("/upload", upload.single("file"), (req, res) => {
  // File upload complete
  console.log(req.file); // Access the uploaded file details here
  
  res.sendStatus(200); // Respond with success status code
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server started on port 3000");
});
```

## Conclusion

With the help of AJAX, we can now enable file uploads in JavaScript without requiring a page refresh. By utilizing the `XMLHttpRequest` object, we can send the selected file to the server and handle the upload process asynchronously. Remember to handle the server-side implementation accordingly to complete the upload process.

Using AJAX for file uploads provides a better user experience by eliminating the need for page refreshes and allowing for progress tracking. This technique is widely used in modern web applications for various file handling scenarios.
