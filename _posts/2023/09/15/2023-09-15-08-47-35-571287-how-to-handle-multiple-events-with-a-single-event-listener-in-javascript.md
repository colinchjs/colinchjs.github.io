In JavaScript, it is common to attach event listeners to elements in order to respond to different user interactions such as clicks, hover, or keyboard events. In some cases, you may want to handle multiple events with a single event listener to keep your code concise and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Here's an example of how you can handle multiple events with a single event listener in JavaScript:

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("#myButton");

function handleClick(event) {
  // Handle event logic here...
}

button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
button.addEventListener("mouseover", handleClick);
button.addEventListener("keydown", handleClick);
```

In the above code, we have a button element with the id "myButton". We define a function named `handleClick` that will handle the logic for all the events we want to listen to. Then, we use the `addEventListener` method to attach the `handleClick` function as the event listener for the "click", "mouseover", and "keydown" events on the button element.

By using a single event listener for multiple events, we can encapsulate our logic in a single function, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. This approach also reduces the amount of code duplication and makes it easier to update or remove event listeners in the future.

Remember to always remove the event listener when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks and improve performance:

```javascript
button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
button.removeEventListener("mouseover", handleClick);
button.removeEventListener("keydown", handleClick);
```

Using a single event listener for multiple events can be helpful when you want to perform similar actions in response to different user interactions. It provides a flexible and efficient way to handle events in JavaScript.
