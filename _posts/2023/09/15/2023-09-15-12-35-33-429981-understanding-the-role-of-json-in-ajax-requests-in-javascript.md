AJAX allows you to send and receive data asynchronously, without requiring a page reload. This makes web pages more dynamic and responsive, as they can update data in the background without interrupting the user's interaction with the page.

When making an AJAX request, the server typically sends the response in JSON format. JSON is easy to understand for both humans and machines. It consists of key-value pairs, where the keys are always strings, and the values can be strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or arrays.

Here's an example of a JSON object:

```javascript
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

To work with JSON in JavaScript, you can use the built-in `JSON` object. It provides two important methods:

1. `JSON.parse()`: This method is used to parse a JSON string and convert it into a JavaScript object. For example:

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name":"John Doe","age":25,"email":"john.doe@example.com"}';
const jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(jsonObject.name); // Outputs: John Doe
```

2. `JSON.stringify()`: This method is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string. For example:

```javascript
const jsonObject = { "name": "John Doe", "age": 25, "email": "john.doe@example.com" };
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(jsonObject);
console.log(jsonString); // Outputs: {"name":"John Doe","age":25,"email":"john.doe@example.com"}
```

In an AJAX request, you typically use the `XMLHttpRequest` object or the newer `fetch()` API to send the request to the server. Once you receive the response, you can use `JSON.parse()` to convert the JSON string into a JavaScript object and access the data.

Using JSON in AJAX requests is a common practice as it provides a standardized format for transmitting data between the client and the server. It is widely supported and easy to work with in JavaScript.
