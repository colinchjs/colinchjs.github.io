### Introduction

Event listeners in JavaScript allow us to respond to user actions and interactions on a web page. Keyboard events are a common type of event, where we can detect and handle key presses, releases, and other keyboard-related actions.

In this article, we will explore how to use event listeners to capture and handle keyboard events in JavaScript.

### Adding an Event Listener

To begin, we need to add an event listener to detect keyboard events. We can do this by using the `addEventListener` method on the `document` object. Here's an example:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  // code to be executed when a key is pressed
});
```

In the above code snippet, we use the `keydown` event type to listen for key presses. The `addEventListener` function takes two arguments: the event type (`keydown` in this case) and a callback function that will be executed when the event is triggered.

### Handling Keyboard Events

Now that we have set up the event listener, we can handle the keyboard events inside the callback function. The `event` parameter contains information about the triggered event, including the key that was pressed.

Let's take a look at an example that logs the key code to the console whenever a key is pressed:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  console.log('Key code:', event.keyCode);
});
```

In the above code, the `event.keyCode` property gives us the key code of the pressed key. We use `console.log` to display the key code in the browser console.

### Keyboard Event Types

JavaScript provides several event types for keyboard events. Here are a few commonly used types:

- `keydown`: Triggered when a key is first pressed down.
- `keyup`: Triggered when a key is released after being pressed down.
- `keypress`: Triggered when a key is pressed down and released.

You can choose the appropriate event type based on your specific requirements.

### Example: Detecting Enter Key Press

Let's consider a scenario where we want to capture the Enter key press to submit a form. We can modify our event listener as follows:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keypress', function(event) {
  if (event.keyCode === 13) {
    // code to be executed when Enter key is pressed
    // e.g., submitForm();
  }
});
```

In the above code, we check if the `keyCode` is equal to 13, which corresponds to the Enter key. If the condition is true, we can call a function to submit the form or perform any desired action.

### Conclusion

Event listeners for keyboard events in JavaScript allow us to respond to user actions and interactions involving the keyboard. By setting up event listeners and handling keyboard events, we can create dynamic and interactive web applications.

Remember to choose the appropriate event type based on your requirements and utilize the properties available in the event object to extract information about the pressed keys.
