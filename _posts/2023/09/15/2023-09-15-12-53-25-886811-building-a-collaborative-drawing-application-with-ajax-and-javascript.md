Collaboration is key when it comes to creative endeavors. If you are looking to create a drawing application that allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time, then AJAX and JavaScript are the perfect tools for the job. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of building a collaborative drawing application using AJAX and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

1. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. A code editor of your choice
3. Access to a server or a local development environment

## Getting Started

To get started, let's create a basic HTML structure for our drawing application. Start by creating an HTML file and adding the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Collaborative Drawing Application</title>
    <style>
      /* Add your CSS styles here */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>

    <script>
      // Add your JavaScript code here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In the above code, we have created a basic HTML structure with an empty `<canvas>` element, where we will be drawing our graphics.

## Implementing AJAX

Next, we need to implement AJAX functionality to enable real-time collaboration among users. AJAX allows us to send and receive data from the server without refreshing the page.

To implement AJAX, we will use the `XMLHttpRequest` object. In your JavaScript code section, add the following code:

```javascript
// Create a new XMLHttpRequest object
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

// Define a handler function to handle the server response
xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
    // Handle the server response here
  }
};

// Open a connection to the server
xhr.open('GET', '/api/drawings', true);

// Send the request to the server
xhr.send();
```

In the above code, we have created an XMLHttpRequest object and defined a handler function to handle the server response. We then open a connection to the server using the `open()` method and send the request using the `send()` method.

## Drawing on the Canvas

Now that we have our basic HTML structure and AJAX functionality in place, let's add the drawing functionality to our application.

To draw on the canvas, we will need to get the canvas element and access its `getContext()` method. Add the following code to your JavaScript code section:

```javascript
// Get the canvas element
var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');

// Get the 2D drawing context
var context = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Add event listeners to track mouse movements
canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', startDrawing);
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', draw);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', stopDrawing);

// Define the drawing variables
var isDrawing = false;
var lastX = 0;
var lastY = 0;

// Function to start drawing
function startDrawing(e) {
  isDrawing = true;
  [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];
}

// Function to draw on the canvas
function draw(e) {
  if (!isDrawing) return;
  context.beginPath();
  context.moveTo(lastX, lastY);
  context.lineTo(e.offsetX, e.offsetY);
  context.stroke();
  [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];
}

// Function to stop drawing
function stopDrawing() {
  isDrawing = false;
}
```

In the above code, we get the canvas element and the 2D drawing context using `getContext()`. We then add event listeners to track mouse movements and call the appropriate functions to start drawing, draw on the canvas, and stop drawing.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully built a collaborative drawing application using AJAX and JavaScript. With this application, multiple users can draw on the same canvas in real-time. You can further enhance the application by implementing features like different drawing tools, colors, and the ability to save and share drawings.
