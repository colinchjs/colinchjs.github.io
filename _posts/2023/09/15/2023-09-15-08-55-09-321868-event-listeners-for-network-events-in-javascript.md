In web development, it's important to have control over network events such as a page load or AJAX request completion. JavaScript provides us with event listeners that allow us to handle these events efficiently. Let's explore how we can use event listeners for network events in JavaScript.

## Listening for page load event

To listen for the page load event, we can use the `DOMContentLoaded` event. This event is fired when the initial HTML document has finished loading.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  console.log('Page loaded successfully');
});
```
*#JavaScript #WebDevelopment*

## Listening for AJAX requests

To listen for AJAX requests, we can use the `XMLHttpRequest` object's events. The `readystatechange` event is fired whenever the `readyState` property changes during an AJAX request.

```javascript
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.addEventListener('readystatechange', function() {
  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
    console.log('AJAX request completed successfully');
  }
});

xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data', true);
xhr.send();
```
*#JavaScript #AJAX*

## Listening for network status changes

We can also listen for network status changes using the `navigator` object's `online` and `offline` events. The `online` event is triggered when the network connection is available, while the `offline` event is triggered when the network connection is lost.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('online', function() {
  console.log('Network connection is available');
});

window.addEventListener('offline', function() {
  console.log('Network connection is lost');
});
```
*#JavaScript #NetworkEvents*

By utilizing these event listeners, we can effectively handle network events like page load, AJAX requests, and network status changes in JavaScript. This allows us to perform necessary actions and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

Remember to always test your code and handle potential errors to ensure a smooth user experience.
