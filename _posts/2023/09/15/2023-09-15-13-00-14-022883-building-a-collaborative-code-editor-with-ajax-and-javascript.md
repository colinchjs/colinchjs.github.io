Collaborative code editors have gained popularity among developers as they allow multiple programmers to work together on the same codebase in real-time. In this tutorial, we will be building a simple collaborative code editor using AJAX and JavaScript. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure that you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Setting up the HTML structure

We will begin by creating the basic HTML structure for our collaborative code editor. Place the following code inside your HTML file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Collaborative Code Editor</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS styles for the code editor */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="editor">
        <textarea></textarea>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Styling the code editor

Next, let's add some CSS styles to make our code editor visually appealing and user-friendly. Update the CSS styles section as per your preference.

```css
/* CSS styles for the code editor */
#editor {
    width: 100%;
    height: 500px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

## Handling user input

In our JavaScript file (`script.js`), we will handle user input by sending AJAX requests to the server whenever the text in the code editor changes. We will use the `oninput` event to detect changes in the textarea. Add the following code to your `script.js` file:

```javascript
// Listen for input changes in the code editor
document.querySelector('textarea').addEventListener('input', function() {
    // Get the updated code from the textarea
    const code = this.value;

    // Send an AJAX request to update the code
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('POST', '/update', true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    xhr.send(JSON.stringify({ code }));
});
```

## Server-side code

On the server-side, we will handle the POST request and update the code accordingly. Depending on your server-side language of choice, you will need to handle the `/update` endpoint accordingly. Here is an example in Node.js using Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/update', (req, res) => {
    // Update the code here
    const code = req.body.code;
    console.log(`Received updated code: ${code}`);

    // You can broadcast the updated code to other connected users here

    res.sendStatus(200);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000!');
});
```

## Final thoughts

Congratulations! You have successfully built a collaborative code editor using AJAX and JavaScript. Users can now collaborate and edit code in real-time. Feel free to enhance the editor by adding features like syntax highlighting or user authentication.

Remember to handle server-side broadcasting and security measures when implementing this in a production environment.
