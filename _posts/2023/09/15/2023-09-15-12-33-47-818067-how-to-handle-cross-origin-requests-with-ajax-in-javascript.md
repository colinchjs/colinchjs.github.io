Cross-origin requests, also known as CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), are AJAX requests made to a different domain, protocol, or port than the one from which the request originated. This mechanism is put in place by web browsers to enforce security policies and prevent unauthorized access to resources on different domains.

When making a cross-origin request, the client-side JavaScript code must first obtain permission from the server to access the requested resource from a different origin. Without the proper handling, the browser will block the request and prevent the response from being received.

To handle cross-origin requests with AJAX in JavaScript, follow these steps:

## 1. Enable CORS on the server
CORS requests are controlled by the server. The server needs to include the appropriate CORS headers in its responses to allow requests from specific origins. The most commonly used header is `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, which specifies the origin(s) allowed to make requests to the server. For example, to allow requests from any origin, the server should include the following response header:
```javascript
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```
Or, to allow requests only from specific origins:
```javascript
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com
```

## 2. Use XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API with CORS
Next, in your JavaScript code, use either the `XMLHttpRequest` or `Fetch API` to make the cross-origin request. Both options support CORS.

### Using XMLHttpRequest:
```javascript
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'http://api.example.com/data', true);
xhr.withCredentials = true; // If you need to send cookies or HTTP Authentication information
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
        var response = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        // Process the response data
    }
};
xhr.send();
```

### Using Fetch API:
```javascript
fetch('http://api.example.com/data', {
    method: 'GET',
    mode: 'cors', // Enable CORS
    credentials: 'include' // If you need to send cookies or HTTP Authentication information
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    // Process the response data
})
.catch(error => {
    // Handle any errors
});
```

These examples show how to make a simple GET request, but you can use similar syntax for other types of requests like POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

## Conclusion
Handling cross-origin requests with AJAX in JavaScript requires enabling CORS on the server and using the appropriate techniques in the client-side code. By following these steps, you can make cross-origin requests and access resources from different domains while ensuring the necessary security measures are in place.
