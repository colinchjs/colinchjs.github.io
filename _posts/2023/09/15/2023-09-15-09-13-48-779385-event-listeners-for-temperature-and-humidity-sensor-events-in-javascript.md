When working with temperature and humidity sensors in JavaScript, it is important to set up event listeners to capture and handle data from these sensors. Event listeners allow you to execute code when a specific event occurs, such as when a new temperature or humidity reading is available from the sensor.

To set up an event listener for temperature sensor events in JavaScript, you can use the `addEventListener` method on the sensor object. Here's an example:

```javascript
const temperatureSensor = document.getElementById('temperature-sensor');

temperatureSensor.addEventListener('tempChange', function(event) {
  const temperature = event.detail.temperature;
  console.log(`New temperature reading: ${temperature}Â°C`);
});
```

In this example, we select the temperature sensor element using `getElementById` and then add an event listener using `addEventListener`. The event we are listening for is called `'tempChange'`, which could be a custom event triggered by the sensor when a new temperature reading is available.

Inside the event listener function, we can access the temperature reading using `event.detail.temperature`. We then log the temperature value to the console.

Similarly, for humidity sensor events, we can set up an event listener like this:

```javascript
const humiditySensor = document.getElementById('humidity-sensor');

humiditySensor.addEventListener('humidityChange', event => {
  const humidity = event.detail.humidity;
  console.log(`New humidity reading: ${humidity}%`);
});
```

In this example, we select the humidity sensor element and add an event listener for `'humidityChange'` events. When a new humidity reading is available, the event listener function is executed, and the humidity value is logged to the console.

Remember to replace `#temperature-sensor` and `#humidity-sensor` with the actual IDs of your temperature and humidity sensor elements in your HTML.

By using event listeners in JavaScript, you can easily capture and handle temperature and humidity sensor events in your web applications. This allows you to update your UI, perform calculations, or trigger other actions based on the sensor data.
