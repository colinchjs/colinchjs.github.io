## Filtering Data

Filtering data with iterators allows you to select a subset of elements from a collection based on specific criteria. The `filter` method provided by iterators enables you to easily achieve this.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to filter an array of numbers using an iterator:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const filteredNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
console.log(filteredNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

In the above code snippet, we call the `filter` method on the `numbers` array. The callback function passed to `filter` returns `true` for numbers that are even, and `false` for numbers that are odd. The `filter` method then creates a new array containing only the elements that passed the filter condition.

You can also use iterators to filter data based on other criteria, such as string matching or object properties.

## Mapping Data

Mapping data with iterators allows you to transform each element in a collection into a new value. The `map` method provided by iterators makes this process simple and concise.

Consider the following example where we want to double each number in an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In the above code, we call the `map` method on the `numbers` array and pass a callback function that multiplies each number by 2. The `map` method then applies this transformation to each element and returns a new array containing the transformed values.

Similarly, you can use iterators to perform more complex transformations, such as converting objects to a different shape or extracting specific properties from a collection of objects.

## Conclusion

Using iterators in JavaScript allows you to efficiently filter and map data in a collection. The `filter` method helps you select elements that meet specific criteria, while the `map` method allows you to transform elements into new values. These operations can be powerful when working with large datasets and are a fundamental part of modern JavaScript programming.
