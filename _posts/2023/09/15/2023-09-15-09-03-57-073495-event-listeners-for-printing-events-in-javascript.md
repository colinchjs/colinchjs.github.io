In JavaScript, event listeners allow us to respond to various events that occur on a webpage. One common use case is capturing print events to perform specific actions before or after a page is printed. Let's explore how we can implement event listeners for printing events in JavaScript.

## Adding a Print Event Listener

To capture the print event, we can add an event listener to the `window` object with the `beforeprint` or `afterprint` event.

```javascript
window.addEventListener("beforeprint", function() {
  // Code to execute before printing
});

window.addEventListener("afterprint", function() {
  // Code to execute after printing
});
```

## Example: Modifying Page Content Before Print

One practical use case for capturing the print event is modifying the page content before it gets printed. For instance, we may want to hide certain elements or apply specific formatting for a better printing experience.

```javascript
window.addEventListener("beforeprint", function() {
  // Hide the navigation bar before printing
  const navBar = document.getElementById("navigation");
  navBar.style.display = "none";
});
```

## Example: Performing Actions After Print

We can also use the `afterprint` event to perform actions after the page has finished printing. For example, we may want to restore the page content to its original state or display a confirmation message.

```javascript
window.addEventListener("afterprint", function() {
  // Show a message after printing is complete
  console.log("Printing is complete!");

  // Restore the navigation bar
  const navBar = document.getElementById("navigation");
  navBar.style.display = "block";
});
```

## Conclusion

By adding event listeners for printing events in JavaScript, we can customize the behavior and appearance of a webpage before or after it is printed. This allows us to enhance the user's printing experience and perform additional actions if needed. Remember to handle both the `beforeprint` and `afterprint` events as necessary.
