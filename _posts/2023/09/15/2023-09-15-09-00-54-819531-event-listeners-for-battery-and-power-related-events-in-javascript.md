In modern web development, it is important to consider the power efficiency and battery life of devices. JavaScript provides several event listeners that you can use to monitor and respond to changes in the battery and power status of a user's device. These event listeners can be useful to inform users about their device's battery level, optimize the performance of your web application, or trigger specific actions based on power-related events.

## Battery Status API

The Battery Status API provides a way to access and monitor the battery information of a user's device. This API can be accessed using the `navigator.getBattery()` method, which returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `BatteryManager` object.

**Example code:**

```javascript
// Check browser support
if ('getBattery' in navigator) {
  navigator.getBattery().then(function(battery) {
    // Add event listener for battery level change
    battery.addEventListener('levelchange', function() {
      console.log('Battery level:', battery.level);
    });

    // Add event listener for charging change
    battery.addEventListener('chargingchange', function() {
      console.log('Charging:', battery.charging);
    });

    // Add event listener for discharging time change
    battery.addEventListener('dischargingtimechange', function() {
      console.log('Discharging time:', battery.dischargingTime);
    });

    // Add event listener for charging time change
    battery.addEventListener('chargingtimechange', function() {
      console.log('Charging time:', battery.chargingTime);
    });
  });
} else {
  console.log('Battery Status API not supported.');
}
```

In the example above, we first check if the browser supports the Battery Status API using the `getBattery` method. If supported, we add event listeners for various battery-related events like `levelchange`, `chargingchange`, `dischargingtimechange`, and `chargingtimechange`.

## Battery API Events

In addition to the Battery Status API, there are also standard battery events available in JavaScript that you can use to listen for changes in power-related events.

**Example code:**

```javascript
// Add event listener for battery level change
window.addEventListener('levelchange', function(event) {
  var battery = navigator.battery || navigator.mozBattery || navigator.webkitBattery;
  console.log('Battery level:', battery.level);
});

// Add event listener for battery charging change
window.addEventListener('chargingchange', function(event) {
  var battery = navigator.battery || navigator.mozBattery || navigator.webkitBattery;
  console.log('Charging:', battery.charging);
});
```

In the example above, we add event listeners for the `levelchange` and `chargingchange` events to monitor battery level and charging status changes, respectively. We first check which Battery API is supported (`navigator.battery`, `navigator.mozBattery`, or `navigator.webkitBattery`), and then log the relevant information to the console.

## Conclusion

Monitoring battery and power-related events in JavaScript allows you to develop power-efficient web applications and provide a better user experience. By utilizing the Battery Status API or the standard battery events, you can update your application based on the device's battery level and charging status. This can help optimize performance and make informed decisions about resource-intensive operations.
