QR code scanners have become increasingly popular for various applications, such as ticketing, online payments, and event check-ins. In JavaScript, we can easily incorporate QR code scanning functionality by utilizing event listeners. Event listeners allow us to detect and respond to specific events triggered by the QR code scanner.

## Setting up the HTML

First, let's set up the HTML structure for the QR code scanner. We will use an `<input>` element to capture the scanned QR code value.

```html
<input type="text" id="qrCodeInput" placeholder="Scan QR Code">
```

## Adding Event Listeners

To capture the QR code scanner events, we need to add event listeners to the `<input>` element. In this example, we'll focus on two key events: `input` and `change`.

The `input` event is triggered when the scanned QR code value is entered or changed in the input field. The `change` event, on the other hand, is fired when the input field loses focus and its value has been modified.

Let's see how to add event listeners using JavaScript:

```javascript
const qrCodeInput = document.getElementById('qrCodeInput');

qrCodeInput.addEventListener('input', (event) => {
  const scannedValue = event.target.value;
  
  // Do something with the scanned value
  console.log(`Scanned QR Code: ${scannedValue}`);
});

qrCodeInput.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
  const scannedValue = event.target.value;
  
  // Do something with the scanned value
  console.log(`Scanned QR Code: ${scannedValue}`);
});
```

## Handling the Scanned QR Code Value

Once a QR code is scanned and an event is triggered, we can access the scanned value using `event.target.value`. In the provided example, we simply log the scanned value to the console. However, you can modify the code to perform any desired action based on the scanned value.

For example, you might want to validate the scanned QR code against a specific pattern, make an API call to retrieve additional information, or update the UI with the scanned value.

## Conclusion

By adding event listeners to the input field, we can easily capture and handle events triggered by a QR code scanner in JavaScript. This allows us to seamlessly integrate QR code scanning functionality into our web applications.

Remember to make use of the `input` and `change` events depending on your requirements. Feel free to explore other events available and customize them to suit your specific needs.
