In JavaScript, both cookies and local storage are used to store data on the client-side. However, there are some key differences between these two storage mechanisms.

1. Data Size Limit:
   - Cookies: Cookies have a maximum size limit of 4KB. This size restriction is imposed because cookies are sent back and forth with every server request, impacting network performance.
   - Local Storage: Local storage can store significantly larger amounts of data, usually around 5MB. It is designed for more persistent storage and is not sent to the server with every request.

2. Data Expiration:
   - Cookies: Cookies can be set with an expiration date. By default, cookies are stored until they are manually deleted or when they reach their expiration date, whichever comes first. This makes cookies suitable for implementing features like "remember me" functionality.
   - Local Storage: Data stored in local storage persists until explicitly deleted by the user or cleared programmatically. It does not have an expiration date, making it ideal for storing long-term user preferences or application state.

3. Data Accessibility:
   - Cookies: Cookies are sent back and forth with each HTTP request, including API requests. They are accessible both on the server-side and client-side. Cookies can be used for transmitting data between the client and the server.
   - Local Storage: Local storage is only accessible on the client-side. It is not sent to the server with each request, making it a more secure option for storing sensitive information.

4. Automatic Inclusion in HTTP Requests:
   - Cookies: Cookies are automatically included in HTTP requests to the same domain they were set from. This makes them suitable for implementing session management and authentication.
   - Local Storage: Local storage data is not automatically included in HTTP requests. Therefore, it requires manual handling and appending the data to the request headers if needed.

5. API Support:
   - Cookies: Cookies have built-in browser APIs for easy management, including setting, retrieving, and deleting cookies.
   - Local Storage: Local storage also has APIs for interacting with the data, providing methods like `setItem()`, `getItem()`, and `removeItem()`.

In conclusion, cookies and local storage serve different purposes in JavaScript. Cookies are generally used for session management, authentication, and transmitting data between the client and server, while local storage is more suitable for long-term storage of user preferences and application state on the client-side.
