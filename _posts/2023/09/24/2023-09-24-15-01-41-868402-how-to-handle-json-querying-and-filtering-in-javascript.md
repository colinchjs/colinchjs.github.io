JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data interchange format used for storing and transmitting data. JavaScript provides powerful built-in methods for querying and filtering JSON objects. In this blog post, we will explore different techniques and functions to handle JSON querying and filtering using JavaScript.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into JSON querying and filtering, ensure you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and JSON syntax.

## 1. Parsing JSON
First, we need to parse the JSON data into a JavaScript object. We can use the `JSON.parse()` method to achieve this. Here's an example:

```javascript
const jsonString = `{"name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}`;
const jsonObj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(jsonObj.name); // John
console.log(jsonObj.age);  // 30
```

## 2. Querying JSON Objects
To query a JSON object, we can use dot notation (`.`) or bracket notation (`[]`). Here are examples of querying a JSON object:

```javascript
const person = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
};

console.log(person.name);  // John
console.log(person["age"]); // 30
```

## 3. Filtering JSON Arrays
When dealing with JSON arrays, we often need to filter based on specific criteria. JavaScript provides the `Array.filter()` method to achieve this. Here's an example:

```javascript
const products = [
  { "name": "iPhone", "price": 999 },
  { "name": "Samsung Galaxy", "price": 799 },
  { "name": "Google Pixel", "price": 699 }
];

const expensiveProducts = products.filter(product => product.price > 800);
console.log(expensiveProducts);
```

This will output an array containing products with prices greater than 800:

```javascript
[
  { "name": "iPhone", "price": 999 },
  { "name": "Samsung Galaxy", "price": 799 }
]
```

## 4. Advanced Queries with Lodash
If you need more advanced querying and filtering functionalities, you can leverage the power of a library like Lodash. Lodash provides a wide range of utility functions for working with data structures in JavaScript, including powerful options for querying and filtering JSON objects and arrays.

To get started with Lodash, you can include the library in your project by using a package manager like npm or including it directly via a CDN. Then, you can import the necessary functions and start using them in your code.

Here's an example of filtering a JSON array using Lodash:

```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');

const products = [
  { "name": "iPhone", "price": 999 },
  { "name": "Samsung Galaxy", "price": 799 },
  { "name": "Google Pixel", "price": 699 }
];

const expensiveProducts = _.filter(products, { price: 999 });
console.log(expensiveProducts);
```

In this example, `_.filter()` is used to filter the array based on a specific criterion, in this case, the price of 999.

## Conclusion
Handling JSON querying and filtering in JavaScript is made easy with the built-in methods like `JSON.parse()` and `Array.filter()`. However, if you require more advanced functionality, libraries like Lodash provide additional options. Understanding these techniques can greatly improve your ability to manipulate and extract data from JSON objects and arrays in JavaScript.
