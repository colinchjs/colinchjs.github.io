Circular references occur when an object references itself or when two or more objects reference each other in a loop. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data interchange format, and circular references can pose challenges when working with JSON objects in JavaScript.

Circular references can cause issues when serializing or deserializing JSON objects, as they can lead to infinite loops or unexpected behavior. However, there are a few approaches to handle circular references in JavaScript.

## 1. Using JSON.stringify() with a replacer function

JavaScript's `JSON.stringify()` method allows us to serialize objects into JSON strings. By providing a replacer function as the second parameter, we can customize the serialization process and handle circular references. 

Example code:

```javascript
const obj = {};
obj.circular = obj;    // Creating a circular reference

const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj, (key, value) => {
  if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null) {
    if (circularRefs.has(value)) {
      // Reference already seen, replace with a placeholder
      return '[Circular Reference]';
    }
    circularRefs.add(value);
  }
  return value;
});

console.log(jsonString);
```

In the above example, we use a `Set` (named `circularRefs`) to keep track of objects we have already encountered. If we encounter a circular reference, we return a placeholder string ('[Circular Reference]') to break the loop. 

## 2. Using a library

Another approach is to use a library that provides circular reference support out of the box. One such library is `flatted`, which handles circular references by replacing them with references to their original locations in the object.

Example code:

```javascript
const flatted = require('flatted');

const obj = {};
obj.circular = obj;    // Creating a circular reference

const jsonString = flatted.stringify(obj);
console.log(jsonString);
```

In this example, we use the `flatted.stringify()` method from the `flatted` library to serialize the object into a JSON string. The library takes care of handling circular references and keeps track of their original locations.
