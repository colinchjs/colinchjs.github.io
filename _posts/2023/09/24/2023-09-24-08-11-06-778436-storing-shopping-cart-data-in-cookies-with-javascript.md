In an e-commerce website, it is important to keep track of the items that a user adds to their shopping cart. One common approach to storing this data is by using cookies in JavaScript. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on the user's browser, allowing for persistent data storage.

Let's take a look at how we can store shopping cart data in cookies using JavaScript:

## Step 1: Adding Items to the Shopping Cart

When a user adds an item to their shopping cart, we need to store this information. We can do this by creating an array to hold the item data.

```javascript
var cart = [];

function addToCart(item) {
  cart.push(item);
}
```

In this example, the `addToCart` function takes an `item` parameter and adds it to the `cart` array.

## Step 2: Storing Shopping Cart Data in Cookies

To store the shopping cart data in a cookie, we can utilize the `document.cookie` property in JavaScript. We will convert the `cart` array into a JSON string and assign it to the cookie. 

```javascript
function saveCartToCookie() {
  var cartData = JSON.stringify(cart);
  document.cookie = "cart=" + cartData + "; expires=Thu, 31 Dec 2099 23:59:59 GMT";
}
```

In this code snippet, we convert the `cart` array into a JSON string using `JSON.stringify`. Then, we set the value of the cookie named "cart" to the `cartData` string. We also provide an expiration date for the cookie, ensuring that it lasts for a long time (in this example, until the end of the year 2099).

## Step 3: Retrieving Shopping Cart Data from Cookies

To retrieve the shopping cart data from the cookie, we need to parse the JSON string stored in the cookie and assign it to the `cart` array.

```javascript
function getCartDataFromCookie() {
  var decodedCookie = decodeURIComponent(document.cookie);
  var cookieData = decodedCookie.split(';');
  
  for (var i = 0; i < cookieData.length; i++) {
    var cookie = cookieData[i].trim();
    
    if (cookie.indexOf("cart=") === 0) {
      var cartData = cookie.substring("cart=".length, cookie.length);
      cart = JSON.parse(cartData);
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

In this code snippet, we retrieve the value of the cookie named "cart" using the `document.cookie` property. We split the cookie string by semicolons to get an array of each cookie. Then, we loop through each cookie to find the one with the name "cart". Once found, we extract the cart data from the cookie, parse it using `JSON.parse`, and assign it to the `cart` array.

## Conclusion

By storing shopping cart data in cookies with JavaScript, we can provide a convenient and persistent way of keeping track of the items that a user adds to their cart. This allows for a seamless shopping experience and ensures that the cart data is accessible even if the user navigates away from the website.
