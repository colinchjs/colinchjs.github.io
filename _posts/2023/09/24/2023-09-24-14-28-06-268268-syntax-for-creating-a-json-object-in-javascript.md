JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data-interchange format used to store and transmit data. In JavaScript, you can create a JSON object using a simple syntax.

Here's an example of how to create a JSON object in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Create a JSON object
var person = {
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
};
```

In the example above, we have created a JSON object called `person` with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `city`. Each property is assigned a value, enclosed in quotes for strings and without quotes for numbers.

You can access the properties of a JSON object using dot notation or square brackets:

```javascript
// Accessing properties of the JSON object
var name = person.name;     // Using dot notation
var age = person["age"];    // Using square brackets

console.log(name);  // Output: "John Doe"
console.log(age);   // Output: 30
```

To access a property value, we simply use the name of the property followed by either a dot or square brackets.

### Conclusion

Creating a JSON object in JavaScript is straightforward. Using the syntax demonstrated above, you can easily create and access properties of a JSON object. JSON objects are widely used for data exchange between a client and a server in web applications.
