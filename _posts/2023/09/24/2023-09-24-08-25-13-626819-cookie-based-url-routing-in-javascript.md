URL routing is an essential part of web development, allowing us to map URLs to different parts of our application or website. There are various routing techniques available, and one popular method is cookie-based URL routing.

In cookie-based URL routing, we use browser cookies to store routing information, allowing us to maintain the current route even after the page is refreshed or closed. This approach can be handy when dealing with single-page applications or websites that require stateful navigation.

## Setting up the Cookie

Before we can start using cookie-based URL routing, we need to set up the cookie that will store our routing information. In JavaScript, we can easily set or update a cookie using the `document.cookie` property.

```javascript
function setCookie(name, value, days) {
  const expires = new Date();
  expires.setTime(expires.getTime() + days * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  document.cookie = `${name}=${value};expires=${expires.toUTCString()};path=/`;
}
```

The `setCookie` function takes in three parameters: the name of the cookie, its value, and the number of days it should persist. It calculates the expiration date based on the provided number of days and sets the cookie using `document.cookie`.

## Routing based on the Cookie

Once we have the cookie set up, we can use its value to determine which route our application should display. This can be achieved by reading the cookie value and performing the necessary actions accordingly.

```javascript
function handleRouting() {
  const route = getCookie('route');
  switch (route) {
    case 'home':
      // Display the home page
      break;
    case 'about':
      // Display the about page
      break;
    case 'contact':
      // Display the contact page
      break;
    default:
      // Display a default page or handle invalid routes
  }
}

function getCookie(name) {
  const cookies = document.cookie.split(';');
  for (let i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) {
    const cookie = cookies[i].trim();
    if (cookie.startsWith(`${name}=`)) {
      return cookie.substring(name.length + 1);
    }
  }
  return '';
}
```

The `handleRouting` function reads the value of the "route" cookie and switches based on the different possible values. Depending on the value, we can display the corresponding page or take appropriate actions.

The `getCookie` function retrieves the value of a cookie by searching for the cookie name within the `document.cookie` string. It splits the string into individual cookies, trims each cookie, and checks if it starts with the desired name.

## Updating the Routing Cookie

To update the routing cookie when a user navigates to a different route, we need a way to write the new route value to the cookie. This can be achieved using a function like the following:

```javascript
function updateRoute(newRoute) {
  setCookie('route', newRoute, 7); // Update the route cookie for 7 days
}
```

The `updateRoute` function simply calls the `setCookie` function we defined earlier, providing the new route value and the desired number of days for the cookie to persist.

## Conclusion

Cookie-based URL routing in JavaScript allows us to maintain the current route of our application or website using browser cookies. By setting and updating the routing cookie, we can easily navigate between different routes and display the appropriate content.

Using cookie-based URL routing can be beneficial in scenarios where we want to maintain the state of our single-page applications or handle stateful navigation. It provides a simple and effective solution for managing routes in JavaScript applications.
