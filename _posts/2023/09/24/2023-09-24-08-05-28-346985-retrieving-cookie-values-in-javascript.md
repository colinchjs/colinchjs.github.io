Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a client's computer by a web server. They are commonly used to store user preferences, session identifiers, and other information that can be accessed by both the server and the client.

In JavaScript, you can retrieve the values of cookies using the `document.cookie` property. This property returns a string that contains all the cookies associated with the current document.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to retrieve the value of a specific cookie:

```javascript
function getCookieValue(cookieName) {
  var cookieValue = null;
  var cookies = document.cookie.split(';');
  
  for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) {
    var cookie = cookies[i].trim();
    
    // Check if the cookie starts with the desired name
    if (cookie.indexOf(cookieName + '=') === 0) {
      
      // Extract the cookie value
      cookieValue = cookie.substring(cookieName.length + 1, cookie.length);
      break;
    }
  }
  
  return cookieValue;
}

// Usage example
var myCookieValue = getCookieValue('myCookie');
console.log('The value of myCookie is: ' + myCookieValue);
```

In the above code, the `getCookieValue` function accepts the name of the cookie as an argument. It then loops through all the cookies retrieved from `document.cookie` and searches for the one that matches the provided name. Once found, it extracts and returns the cookie value.

Remember to replace `'myCookie'` with the actual name of the cookie you want to retrieve. Additionally, please note that the cookie string returned by `document.cookie` may contain multiple cookies separated by semicolons.

By using the above code snippet, you can easily retrieve the values of cookies in JavaScript and utilize them in your web applications.
