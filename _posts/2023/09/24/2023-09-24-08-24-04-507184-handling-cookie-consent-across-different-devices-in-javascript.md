In today's digital landscape, ensuring compliance with data privacy laws and regulations is crucial. One of the key aspects of data privacy involves obtaining user consent for the use of cookies on your website.

With users accessing websites from a wide range of devices, it becomes essential to handle cookie consent in a way that is consistent across different devices. In this blog post, we will explore how to handle cookie consent in JavaScript across various devices.

## Step 1: Storing Consent

The first step is to store the user's cookie consent preference in a way that can be accessed across different devices. We can achieve this by using browser storage mechanisms such as `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.

Example code using `localStorage`:

```javascript
// Check if the user has already given consent
if (!localStorage.getItem('cookieConsent')) {
  // Display the cookie consent banner

  // Handle user interaction to give or deny consent

  // Store the consent preference
  localStorage.setItem('cookieConsent', true);
}
```

## Step 2: Displaying the Cookie Consent Banner

The next step is to display the cookie consent banner to the user when they visit your website. You can achieve this by creating a banner element in your HTML markup and styling it accordingly.

Example code for the cookie consent banner:

```javascript
// HTML markup for the cookie consent banner
const bannerMarkup =
  `<div id="cookie-consent-banner">
    <p>This website uses cookies to enhance your experience. <a href="/privacy-policy">Learn more</a></p>
    <button id="accept-cookie">Accept</button>
    <button id="reject-cookie">Reject</button>
  </div>`;

// Append the banner markup to the body element
document.body.innerHTML += bannerMarkup;

// Event listener for the accept cookie button
document.getElementById('accept-cookie').addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Store the consent preference
  localStorage.setItem('cookieConsent', true);
});

// Event listener for the reject cookie button
document.getElementById('reject-cookie').addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Store the consent preference
  localStorage.setItem('cookieConsent', false);
});
```

## Step 3: Handling Consent Preference

Finally, we need to ensure that our website adheres to the user's consent preference. This involves either allowing or blocking the use of cookies based on the stored preference.

Example code for handling the consent preference:

```javascript
// Check the stored consent preference
const consentPreference = localStorage.getItem('cookieConsent');

if (consentPreference === null) {
  // Consent preference not set, handle as required
} else if (consentPreference === 'true') {
  // User has given consent, initialize cookies and related functionality
} else if (consentPreference === 'false') {
  // User has denied consent, disable cookies and related functionality
}
```

By following these steps, you can ensure consistent handling of cookie consent across different devices in JavaScript. Remember, it is essential to implement these mechanisms to respect the privacy preferences of your website visitors.
