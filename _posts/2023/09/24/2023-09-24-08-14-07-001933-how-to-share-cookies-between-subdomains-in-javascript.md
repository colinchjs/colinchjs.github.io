When working with subdomains in JavaScript, sharing cookies can be a common requirement. By default, cookies are isolated to the domain they are set on, which means that cookies set on one subdomain are not accessible on another subdomain. However, there are techniques you can use to enable cookie sharing between subdomains. In this blog post, we will explore two methods to achieve this.

## Method 1: Setting the Domain Attribute

One way to share cookies between subdomains is by setting the `domain` attribute when creating or setting a cookie. By specifying the **root domain** as the `domain` attribute, the cookie becomes accessible to all subdomains under that root domain.

```javascript
document.cookie = "cookieName=cookieValue;domain=.example.com";
```

In the above example, the cookie is set on the domain `.example.com`, which means it will be accessible to any subdomain under `example.com` such as `subdomain1.example.com` and `subdomain2.example.com`.

Keep in mind that this method has its limitations. The main constraint is that the **root domain** must be the same for all subdomains involved. Additionally, you may encounter issues if the `Secure` or `HttpOnly` attributes are set for the cookie.

## Method 2: Using localStorage or sessionStorage

An alternative approach to sharing data between subdomains is by using the `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` API provided by modern browsers. Unlike cookies, which are automatically included in HTTP requests, using `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` allows you to manually store and retrieve data across subdomains.

```javascript
// Setting a value in localStorage
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");

// Retrieving the value from localStorage
const value = localStorage.getItem("key");
```

The `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` objects store data as key-value pairs, where both the key and value are strings. This means you may need to stringify objects before saving them and parse them back into objects when retrieving them.

Using this method, you can easily share data between subdomains regardless of the root domain. However, keep in mind that the data stored in `localStorage` persists even after the browser is closed, while `sessionStorage` data is cleared when the session ends.

## Conclusion

Sharing cookies between subdomains in JavaScript can be achieved by setting the `domain` attribute or by using `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. The method you choose will depend on your specific requirements and constraints.

Remember to consider security implications when sharing cookies or data across subdomains. Also, test your implementation thoroughly to ensure it works as expected across all targeted subdomains.
