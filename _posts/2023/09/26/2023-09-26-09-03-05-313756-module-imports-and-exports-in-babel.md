Babel is a popular tool used to transpile JavaScript code, allowing you to use modern JavaScript features in older environments. One of the key features of Babel is its support for module imports and exports, which can help organize and modularize your codebase.

## Importing Modules with Babel

To import modules using Babel, you can use the `import` statement. Here's an example:

```javascript
import { add, subtract } from './mathUtils';
```

In the example above, we are importing the `add` and `subtract` functions from a module located at `./mathUtils`. 

You can also import the entire module using the `* as` syntax:

```javascript
import * as mathUtils from './mathUtils';
```

In this case, you will have to use the `mathUtils` object to access the exported functions like `mathUtils.add()`.

## Exporting Modules with Babel

To export modules using Babel, you can use the `export` statement. Here's an example:

```javascript
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
```

In the example above, we are exporting the `add` and `subtract` functions as named exports from the module.

You can also export a module as a default export using the `export default` statement:

```javascript
export default function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

With a default export, you can import it using any name you prefer:

```javascript
import multiply from './mathUtils';
```

## Summary

Babel provides support for importing and exporting modules, allowing you to modularize your JavaScript code. You can import specific functions using named imports, import the entire module using the `* as` syntax, and export functions as named or default exports. Module imports and exports in Babel help you write more modular and maintainable code.
