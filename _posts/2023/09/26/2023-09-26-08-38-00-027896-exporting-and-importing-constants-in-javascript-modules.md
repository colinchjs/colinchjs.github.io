To export a constant from a module, we make use of the `export` keyword followed by the keyword `const`. Let's say we have a module named `constants.js` that contains a constant named `API_URL`. We can export it like this:

```javascript
// constants.js

export const API_URL = "https://api.example.com";
```

In this example, we are exporting the `API_URL` constant with the value `"https://api.example.com"`.

Now, to import this constant in another module, we use the `import` keyword followed by the variable name we want to assign the imported value to. Let's say we want to import the `API_URL` constant into a module named `api.js`. We can do it like this:

```javascript
// api.js

import { API_URL } from './constants.js';

// Use the imported constant
console.log(API_URL);
```

In this example, we import the `API_URL` constant from the `constants.js` module using the `{ }` syntax. We specify the relative path to the `constants.js` file using `'./constants.js'`.

Subsequently, we can use the imported `API_URL` constant as we would any other variable.

It's important to note that the `export` and `import` statements are part of the ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) module system and may not be supported in older browsers. To use these features, you may need to transpile your code using a tool like Babel, or use a bundler like Webpack.

In conclusion, exporting and importing constants in JavaScript modules is a convenient way to share and reuse constants across different parts of your application. It promotes modularity and helps maintain a clean and organized codebase.
