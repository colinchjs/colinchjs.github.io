In JavaScript, there are two important concepts to be aware of when it comes to passing variables: **pass by value** and **context**. Understanding these concepts will help you write better code and avoid common pitfalls. Let's dive in!

## Pass by Value
JavaScript is a **pass by value** language, which means that when you pass a variable to a function, a **copy of the value** is made and passed to the function, rather than the actual variable itself.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```javascript
let num = 10;

function updateNum(value) {
  value = 20;
}

updateNum(num);
console.log(num); // Output: 10
```

In the above example, the `updateNum` function is called with the variable `num` as an argument. Inside the function, a copy of the value of `num` is assigned to the `value` parameter. Any changes made to `value` don't affect the original variable `num`.

## Context
The concept of **context** in JavaScript refers to the value of the `this` keyword within a function. The value of `this` is determined by how a function is invoked.

Consider the following code:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
}

person.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, John

const greet = person.sayHello;
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined
```

In the above example, the `sayHello` function is defined as a method within the `person` object. When `person.sayHello()` is called, `this` refers to the `person` object. However, when the method is assigned to the `greet` variable and called later, `this` loses its context and becomes `undefined`.

To fix this issue, you can use the `bind` method to set the context explicitly:

```javascript
const greet = person.sayHello.bind(person);
greet(); // Output: Hello, John
```

In this modified version, `bind` sets the context of `this` to the `person` object, ensuring that the `sayHello` function is executed within the correct context.

## Conclusion
Understanding pass by value and context in JavaScript is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code. By grasping these concepts, you can avoid common pitfalls and leverage the full potential of JavaScript in your applications.
