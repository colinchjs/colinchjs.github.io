However, there may be situations where you want to import everything from a module. Maybe you are working on a small project or you are certain that there won't be any naming conflicts. In such cases, you can use the `*` operator to import everything from a module.

Here's an example of how you can import everything from a module using the `*` operator in JavaScript:

```javascript
import * as myModule from './myModule.js';
```

In the above example, we are importing everything from the `myModule.js` file and assigning it to the `myModule` object. Now, you can access any function, variable, or class defined in `myModule.js` using the `myModule` object.

For example, if `myModule.js` exports a function called `myFunction` and a variable called `myVariable`, you can use them as follows:

```javascript
myModule.myFunction();
console.log(myModule.myVariable);
```

By using the `*` operator, you import everything from the module and have access to all its exports through a single object. It is important to note that this approach should be used with caution as it can potentially lead to namespace collisions and make your code less maintainable.

So, while it is generally recommended to import only what you need from a module, knowing how to import everything using the `*` operator can be useful in specific scenarios. Just remember to use it judiciously and weigh the trade-offs between convenience and potential issues.
