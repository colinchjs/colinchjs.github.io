Recursion is a powerful concept in programming where a function calls itself repeatedly until a specified condition is met. In JavaScript, recursion can be used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

## Understanding recursion

Recursion relies on the notion of context, which refers to the state of a program at any given point in time. In the case of recursive functions, each function call has its own context, including its own set of variables and parameters.

To better understand recursion, let's consider an example of calculating the factorial of a number.

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  // Base case: return 1 when n is 0 or 1
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    // Recursive case: call the factorial function with n-1 as the argument
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```

In this code snippet, the `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. 

The function has a base case, which is a condition that stops the recursion. In this case, if `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1.

The recursive case is the part of the function that calls itself with a modified input. In this example, `factorial(n - 1)` is called to calculate the factorial of `n - 1`. The final result is then multiplied by `n` to get the factorial of `n`.

## Managing context in recursion

When using recursion, it's essential to manage the context correctly to avoid running into errors like infinite loops or memory overflows. Each recursive call creates a new context with its own set of variables.

To see how context changes with each recursive call, let's modify the previous example slightly:

```javascript
function factorial(n, accumulator = 1) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return accumulator;
  } else {
    return factorial(n - 1, n * accumulator);
  }
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```

In this modified code, an additional parameter `accumulator` is introduced to keep track of the intermediate results during recursion. The recursive call passes `n * accumulator` as the updated `accumulator` value, which allows the function to calculate the factorial correctly.

Managing context effectively is crucial in recursion to ensure correct and efficient execution.
