In JavaScript, object context refers to how a function is invoked and the value of 'this' within that function. The 'this' keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that the function is called on or the object that is being referenced.

## Default Context

By default, when a function is invoked without any explicit context, the 'this' keyword refers to the global object. In a web browser, the global object is the 'window' object. For example:

```javascript
function printName() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const person = {
  name: 'John',
  print: printName
};

person.print(); // Output: John
```

In the example above, when the 'print' function is called on the 'person' object, the 'this' keyword inside the function refers to the 'person' object.

## Explicit Context

In some cases, we may want to specify the context explicitly using methods like 'call', 'apply', or 'bind'. These methods allow us to call a function and explicitly set the 'this' value within that function. For example:

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
}

const person1 = {
  name: 'Alice'
};

const person2 = {
  name: 'Bob'
};

sayHello.call(person1); // Output: Hello, Alice
sayHello.apply(person2); // Output: Hello, Bob

const greet = sayHello.bind(person1);
greet(); // Output: Hello, Alice
```

In the example above, we use the 'call' method to invoke the 'sayHello' function and specify 'person1' as the context. Similarly, the 'apply' method is used with 'person2' as the context. We can also use the 'bind' method to create a new function 'greet' that has 'person1' as its context.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions have lexical scoping of 'this', which means that they inherit the 'this' value of the enclosing scope rather than having their own 'this' value. They do not bind their own 'this' value. For example:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Amy',
  getName: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

person.getName(); // Output: undefined
```

In the example above, the arrow function 'getName' does not have its own 'this' value and instead refers to the 'this' value of the enclosing scope, which is the global object. As a result, the output is 'undefined'.

## Conclusion

Understanding object context and how 'this' behaves in JavaScript is crucial for writing effective code. By understanding default context, explicit context, and the behavior of arrow functions, you can ensure that your code behaves as expected and avoids any unexpected errors.
