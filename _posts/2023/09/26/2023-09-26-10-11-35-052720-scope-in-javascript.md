Scope is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that determines the accessibility and visibility of variables, functions, and objects in your code. It defines the regions of your code where variables and functions can be referenced.

## Global Scope

When a variable or function is declared outside of any function or block, it becomes part of the global scope. It means that it can be accessed from anywhere in your code. Global variables are accessible throughout your entire program, which can lead to potential conflicts and security issues.

Example code in JavaScript:
```javascript
var globalVariable = 'I am a global variable';

function globalFunction() {
   console.log('I am a global function');
}

console.log(globalVariable); // Output: I am a global variable
globalFunction(); // Output: I am a global function
```

## Local Scope

Local scope refers to variables or functions that are declared within a specific block or function. Variables declared within a local scope are only accessible within that particular scope.

Example code in JavaScript:
```javascript
function localScope() {
  var localVariable = 'I am a local variable';

  console.log(localVariable); // Output: I am a local variable
}

localScope();
console.log(localVariable); // Uncaught ReferenceError: localVariable is not defined
```

In this example, `localVariable` is only accessible within the `localScope` function and cannot be accessed outside of it.

## Lexical Scope (Closure)

JavaScript has a feature called lexical scope which allows inner functions to have access to variables declared in their outer functions. This concept is often referred to as a closure.

Example code in JavaScript:
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  var outerVariable = 'I am an outer variable';

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Output: I am an outer variable
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```

In this example, `innerFunction` has access to the `outerVariable` declared in its parent function `outerFunction`. This is possible because of lexical scoping.

Understanding scope in JavaScript is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable code. By properly managing variable scope, you can avoid naming conflicts and unintended side effects in your code. Remember to always declare variables within the appropriate scope and minimize the use of global variables whenever possible.
