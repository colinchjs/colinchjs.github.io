Memoization is a technique used in programming to optimize function calls by caching the results of expensive calculations. It is particularly useful when dealing with recursive functions or functions that require a significant amount of computation.

JavaScript provides several ways to implement memoization. One commonly used approach is to leverage the context object (`this`) to store the cached results. By using the context, we can easily access the cached values and avoid unnecessary computation.

Here's an example of how we can implement memoization using the context in JavaScript:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 2) {
    return 1;
  }

  // Check if the result is already cached
  if (this.cache && this.cache[n]) {
    return this.cache[n];
  }

  // Calculate the fibonacci number for n
  const result = fibonacci.call(this, n - 1) + fibonacci.call(this, n - 2);

  // Cache the result for future use
  this.cache = this.cache || {};
  this.cache[n] = result;

  return result;
}

console.log(fibonacci.call({}, 6)); // 8
```

In the code above, we define a recursive `fibonacci` function that calculates the Fibonacci number for a given `n` using memoization. We use the `call` method to bind an empty object as the context (`this`) for the function calls.

Inside the function, we check if the result for `n` is already cached in the `cache` property of the context object. If it is, we return the cached value. Otherwise, we calculate the Fibonacci number by recursively calling `fibonacci` for `n - 1` and `n - 2`, and then cache the result for future use.

By using the context object for memoization, we can easily store and access the cached results without polluting the global scope or introducing additional parameters to the function.

Remember to use the `call` method to bind the context object when invoking the memoized function, as shown in the example above.
