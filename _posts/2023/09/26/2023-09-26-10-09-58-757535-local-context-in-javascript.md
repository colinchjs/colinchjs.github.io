When a function is executed, a new local context is created. Variables and functions defined within this context are only accessible within that function and are not visible outside of it. This concept helps in encapsulating code and preventing naming conflicts.

Let's see an example to better understand local context in JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet() {
  let name = 'John'; // local variable within the greet function

  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); // accessing the local variable

  function sayGoodbye() {
    console.log(`Goodbye, ${name}!`); // accessing the local variable from the nested function
  }

  sayGoodbye(); // invoking the nested function
}

greet(); // calling the greet function
```

In the above code, the `name` variable is defined within the `greet` function's local context. It can be accessed by any code within the `greet` function, including the nested `sayGoodbye` function. However, the `name` variable is not accessible outside the `greet` function.

By using local context effectively, we can create modular and reusable code. It also helps in preventing naming conflicts between different parts of our codebase.

Understanding local context in JavaScript is crucial when working with functions, closures, and scoping in general. It allows us to control the accessibility and lifespan of our variables and functions, improving code organization and maintainability.
