## Introduction
In JavaScript, event bubbling refers to the propagation of events through the DOM (Document Object Model) hierarchy. When an event is triggered on an element, it is first handled by that element's event listener, and then it bubbles up to its parent elements and their event listeners. This process continues until the event reaches the top-level element (e.g., the `<html>` element) or until it is explicitly stopped.

## Understanding Event Bubbling
Event bubbling is vital to understand when working with complex web applications or when dealing with nested elements. By default, most events bubble up the DOM hierarchy. This means that if you have a nested structure of elements, such as a `<div>` inside another `<div>`, and you register an event listener on the parent `<div>`, the event will also trigger on the child `<div>` unless explicitly stopped.

```javascript
// HTML structure
<div id="parent">
    <div id="child">
        Click me!
    </div>
</div>

// JavaScript code
const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
const child = document.getElementById('child');

parent.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Parent clicked!');
});

child.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    event.stopPropagation(); // Stop the event from bubbling up
    console.log('Child clicked!');
});
```

In the example above, when you click on the child `<div>`, both event listeners are triggered. However, by calling `event.stopPropagation()`, we stop the event from propagating further up the DOM hierarchy, ensuring that only the child event listener is executed.

## Utilizing Event Context
The event object provides useful information about the triggered event and the element on which it occurred. One key property is `event.target`, which represents the element that triggered the event. This property becomes especially useful when working with event delegation and dynamically created elements.

```javascript
// HTML structure
<ul id="shoppingList">
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Bread</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
</ul>

// JavaScript code
const list = document.getElementById('shoppingList');

list.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    const item = event.target;
    if (item.tagName === 'LI') {
        console.log('Clicked on item:', item.textContent);
    }
});
```

In the above example, the event listener is registered on the parent `<ul>` element. When you click on any of the `<li>` elements within the list, the event listener is triggered. By accessing `event.target` and performing checks, we can identify which specific item was clicked and perform further actions accordingly.

## Conclusion
Understanding event bubbling is crucial for handling events efficiently and maintaining a clean and modular codebase. Leveraging event context through the event object's properties enables us to target specific elements and perform operations dynamically. By utilizing these concepts effectively, you can design more interactive and responsive web applications.
