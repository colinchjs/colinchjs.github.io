JavaScript is a versatile programming language that offers various ways to bind the context of `this` keyword. One of these ways is through implicit binding. Implicit binding occurs when an object invokes a method, and `this` refers to the object itself.

Let's dive deeper into implicit binding and understand how it works.

## How Implicit Binding Works

When a function is called as a method of an object, the object to the left of the dot `.` is what `this` refers to. This is known as implicit binding. 

```javascript
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 25,
    greet: function() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```

In the above example, when the `greet` method is invoked using `person.greet()`, `this` refers to the `person` object. So, `this.name` will be resolved to `"John"`.

## Implicit Binding with Nested Objects

Implicit binding can also be applied to nested objects. In such cases, `this` refers to the immediate parent object in which the method is defined.

```javascript
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 25,
    address: {
        street: "123 Main St",
        city: "New York",
        displayAddress: function() {
            console.log(`I live at ${this.street} in ${this.city}`);
        }
    }
};

person.address.displayAddress(); // Output: I live at 123 Main St in New York
```

In the above example, `this` refers to the `address` object when `displayAddress` method is called. Hence, `this.street` and `this.city` resolve to their respective values within the `address` object.

## Conclusion

Implicit binding allows JavaScript developers to handle object context effectively by utilizing the `this` keyword. By understanding how implicit binding works, developers can ensure that methods are invoked within the correct context, leading to cleaner and more reliable code.
