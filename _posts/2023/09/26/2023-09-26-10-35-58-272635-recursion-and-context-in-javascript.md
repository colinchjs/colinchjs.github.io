Recursion is a powerful programming concept that allows a function to call itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met. This technique can be used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

In JavaScript, recursion is especially useful for handling tasks that involve traversing complex data structures like trees or graphs. However, when using recursion, it's important to understand the concept of context and how it relates to recursive functions.

## What is context in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, the context refers to the value of the `this` keyword within a function. It determines the object to which the function belongs and provides access to its properties and methods. Understanding context is crucial when working with recursion because it affects how the function behaves and what data it can access.

By default, the context within a recursive function is the global object (`window` in a browser or `global` in Node.js). This can lead to unexpected results, as the function may not have access to the necessary data or behave as intended. To ensure proper context, it is common to pass the necessary data explicitly as function arguments.

## Example: Calculating Factorial Using Recursion

Let's look at a common example of using recursion to calculate the factorial of a number.

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  // Base case: return 1 when n is 0 or 1
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  }

  // Recursive case: multiply n by factorial of (n-1)
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```

In this example, the `factorial` function recursively calls itself with a smaller value of `n` until it reaches the base case (when `n` is 0 or 1). This ensures that the function eventually terminates.

## Conclusion

Recursion is a powerful technique in JavaScript that allows you to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. Understanding context is essential when working with recursive functions, as it determines the data that can be accessed within the function. By passing data explicitly as function arguments, you can ensure the desired behavior and prevent unexpected results.
