To define a static property or method in JavaScript, you use the `static` keyword. Here's an example of a class called `MathUtils` that defines a static method for calculating the square of a number:

```javascript
class MathUtils {
  static square(number) {
    return number * number;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.square(5)); // Output: 25
```

In this example, the `square` method is defined as static using the `static` keyword before the method name. You can then call this method directly on the class itself, without creating an instance of the `MathUtils` class.

By using static methods and properties, you can organize related functionality without the need to create objects. They can be useful for utility functions that don't rely on any specific instance data and can be used across multiple instances or in a static context.

Using static methods and properties can also help improve performance, as you avoid the overhead of creating unnecessary object instances. However, keep in mind that static methods cannot access instance-specific properties or methods, as they are not tied to any particular object.

In conclusion, static context in JavaScript allows you to define properties and methods that belong to the class itself rather than individual instances. It provides a way to access these properties and methods without needing to create objects, making it useful for organizing utility functions and improving performance. #JavaScript #StaticContext
