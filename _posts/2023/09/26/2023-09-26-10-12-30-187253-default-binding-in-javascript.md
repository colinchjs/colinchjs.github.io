In JavaScript, the default binding refers to the behavior of the `this` keyword when used outside of any explicit context, such as within a standalone function. Understanding default binding is crucial for properly utilizing the `this` keyword and avoiding unexpected behavior.

## How Default Binding Works

When a function is executed in non-strict mode and there is no explicit context, the `this` keyword by default binds to the global object, which is usually the `window` object in browsers or the global object in Node.js. This binding occurs during runtime and is determined dynamically based on how and where the function is called.

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
}

var name = "John";
sayHello(); // Output: Hello, John
```

In the example above, the `sayHello` function is called without any explicit context. Therefore, the `this` keyword inside the function refers to the global object, where the `name` variable is defined. As a result, the output of `sayHello()` is `"Hello, John"`.

## The Importance of Default Binding

Understanding default binding is crucial for avoiding subtle bugs and unintended behavior. If you accidentally invoke a function without providing a specific context, you may inadvertently modify or access global variables, leading to unexpected outcomes.

To prevent unintentional default binding, it is recommended to use strict mode by placing the line `"use strict";` at the beginning of your JavaScript code. In strict mode, default binding is disabled, and invoking a function without a context will cause `this` to be `undefined` instead of binding to the global object.

```javascript
"use strict";

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
}

var name = "John";
sayHello(); // Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```

As shown in the updated example above, invoking `sayHello()` in strict mode results in an error because `this` is `undefined`. This behavior helps catch potential errors and encourages developers to be more intentional with their code.
