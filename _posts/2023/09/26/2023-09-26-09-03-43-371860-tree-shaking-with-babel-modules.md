When it comes to optimizing our JavaScript applications, one important technique is tree shaking. Tree shaking eliminates unused code from the final bundle, reducing its size and improving performance. Babel, a popular JavaScript compiler, provides support for tree shaking with its modules functionality.

By default, Babel includes all imported modules in the compiled bundle, regardless of whether they are actually used in the code. However, with the help of Babel's modules feature, we can enable tree shaking to remove unused code and reduce the overall bundle size.

To enable tree shaking with Babel, we need to ensure that our project is using ES modules. This can be achieved by setting `modules: false` in the Babel configuration file (`babel.config.js`).

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ['@babel/preset-env', {
      modules: false
    }]
  ]
};
```

Setting `modules: false` instructs Babel to keep the ES6 module syntax in the output code, helping the bundler to perform tree shaking effectively.

Once we have the ES modules enabled, we can configure our bundler (such as Webpack or Rollup) to leverage tree shaking. The bundler should be able to recognize and eliminate the unused code based on the module imports.

For example, let's say we have the following module that exports multiple functions:

```javascript
// math.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
export const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
export const divide = (a, b) => a / b;
```

If we only use the `add` function in our application code, tree shaking will eliminate the unused functions during the bundling process.

It's important to note that tree shaking relies on static analysis of imports and exports. Dynamic imports or require statements might not be optimized due to their dynamic nature.

In conclusion, by enabling tree shaking with Babel modules, we can effectively eliminate unused code from our JavaScript applications, resulting in smaller bundle sizes and improved performance.
