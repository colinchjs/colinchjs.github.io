## Using the `export` keyword

The most common method for exporting data from a JavaScript module is by using the `export` keyword. You can use it with variables, functions, or objects. Let's explore some examples:

### Exporting a Variable

To export a variable, you can simply use the `export` keyword before the declaration:

```javascript
export const myVariable = "Hello, world!";
```

This exports the variable `myVariable` with the value `"Hello, world!"`.

### Exporting a Function

To export a function, you can also use the `export` keyword before the function declaration:

```javascript
export function myFunction() {
  return "Hello, world!";
}
```

This exports the function `myFunction` which returns the string `"Hello, world!"`.

### Exporting an Object

To export an object, you can assign it to a variable and export that variable:

```javascript
const myObject = {
  name: "John",
  age: 28
};

export { myObject };
```

This exports the object `myObject` with its properties `name` and `age`.

## Using the `default` keyword

In addition to the `export` keyword, JavaScript also provides the `default` keyword to export a default value from a module. This is useful when you want to export a single value or when you want to have a fallback export.

### Exporting a Default Value

To export a default value, you can use the `export default` syntax:

```javascript
const myVariable = "Hello, world!";

export default myVariable;
```

This exports the value of `myVariable` as the default export of the module.

You can also combine the export statement with the declaration itself, like this:

```javascript
export default function() {
  return "Hello, world!";
}
```

This exports an anonymous function as the default export.

## Importing the Exported Data

To use the exported data in another module, you need to import it. You can do this using the `import` statement. Let's see some examples:

### Importing a Single Export

To import a single exported value, you can use the `import` statement followed by the name of the export:

```javascript
import { myVariable } from './myModule.js';

console.log(myVariable); // Output: Hello, world!
```

### Importing a Default Export

To import the default export, you can use the `import` statement without the curly braces:

```javascript
import myVariable from './myModule.js';

console.log(myVariable); // Output: Hello, world!
```

### Importing Multiple Exports

You can also import multiple exports by listing them inside the curly braces:

```javascript
import { myVariable, myFunction } from './myModule.js';

console.log(myVariable); // Output: Hello, world!
console.log(myFunction()); // Output: Hello, world!
```

## Conclusion

Exporting data from a JavaScript module is essential for creating modular and reusable code. By using the `export` and `default` keywords, you can easily expose variables, functions, and objects to be used in other parts of your application. Don't forget to import the exported data properly in order to utilize it effectively. Now you have the knowledge and tools to export data from JavaScript modules with ease! #JavaScript #ModuleExports
