In JavaScript, memoization and context are two important concepts that can greatly enhance the performance and functionality of your code. Let's dive into what memoization and context are, and how they can be used in JavaScript.

## Memoization

Memoization is a technique in computer science that allows us to cache the result of a function call based on its inputs. This means that if a function is called with the same arguments multiple times, the function will return the cached result instead of executing the function again. This can significantly improve performance, especially for functions with expensive computations or database queries.

Here's an example of how memoization can be implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript
function memoize(func) {
  const cache = {};
  return function(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (key in cache) {
      return cache[key];
    } else {
      const result = func(...args);
      cache[key] = result;
      return result;
    }
  };
}
```

In this example, we define a higher-order function `memoize` that takes a function `func` as an argument. Inside the returned function, we create a cache object to store the results. We convert the arguments into a string and use it as the cache key to store and retrieve the cached results.

To use the `memoize` function, you can pass any expensive computation function as an argument, and it will be memoized:

```javascript
const fibonacci = memoize(function(num) {
  if (num <= 1) {
    return num;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2);
  }
});
```

Now, every time `fibonacci` is called with the same argument, it will return the cached result instead of recalculating the Fibonacci sequence.

## Context

In JavaScript, context refers to the value of the `this` keyword within a function. It determines how a function is called and what object it has access to.

When a function is called as a method of an object, the context becomes the object itself. However, if a function is called without any context (as a plain function call), the context usually defaults to the global object (e.g., `window` in a browser).

We can also change the context of a function using the `bind`, `call`, or `apply` methods. These methods allow us to explicitly set the context of a function and pass arguments to it.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
  }
};

const anotherPerson = {
  name: "Jane"
};

person.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, John

const greet = person.sayHello.bind(anotherPerson);
greet(); // Output: Hello, Jane
```

In this example, we define a `person` object with a `sayHello` method. By using the `bind` method, we create a new function `greet` that has the `anotherPerson` object as its context. When we call `greet()`, it outputs "Hello, Jane" instead of "Hello, John".

Understanding and utilizing memoization and context in your JavaScript code can help improve performance and control the behavior of your functions. By leveraging these concepts effectively, you can optimize your code and create more modular and reusable functions.
