In this tutorial, we will learn how to add tooltips to buttons in Chakra UI, a popular React component library. Tooltips provide additional information or context when users hover over an element, making the user interface more interactive and user-friendly. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Chakra UI and React set up in your project. If you haven't already done so, you can install Chakra UI by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

## Implementation

1. Import the necessary components and hooks from Chakra UI:

```jsx
import { Tooltip, Button } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { QuestionOutlineIcon } from "@chakra-ui/icons";
```

2. Wrap your button component with the Tooltip component and add the tooltip content as the `label` prop:

```jsx
<Tooltip label="This is a tooltip">
  <Button>
    Tooltip Button
  </Button>
</Tooltip>
```

3. You can customize the appearance of the tooltip using the `bg` (background color), `color` (text color), `borderRadius`, and other props:

```jsx
<Tooltip label="This is a tooltip" bg="blue.500" color="white" borderRadius="md">
  <Button>
    Tooltip Button
  </Button>
</Tooltip>
```

4. To display an icon next to the button, you can use the Tooltip component's `hasArrow` prop and add the icon component as a child of the tooltip:

```jsx
<Tooltip label="This is a tooltip" bg="blue.500" color="white" borderRadius="md" hasArrow>
  <Button>
    <QuestionOutlineIcon />
    Tooltip Button
  </Button>
</Tooltip>
```

That's it! You have successfully added tooltips to Chakra UI buttons. Experiment with different props and styles to customize the appearance of your tooltips.

## Conclusion

Tooltips are a useful feature to enhance the user experience of your web application. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can easily add tooltips to buttons in Chakra UI. Take advantage of this functionality to provide additional information and improve the usability of your user interface.
