React.js has become one of the most popular frontend frameworks in recent years, known for its simplicity and scalability. In this blog post, we will explore how to deploy a React.js application using the serverless deployment platform Vercel (formerly Zeit). 

## Why choose Vercel?

Vercel is a cloud platform that specializes in static site hosting and serverless functions. It provides a seamless and efficient way to deploy React.js applications, taking advantage of its built-in support for serverless functions.

By deploying your React.js application with Vercel, you get benefits such as automatic SSL certificates, global CDN distribution, and instant scalability. Vercel's built-in serverless functions allow you to execute server-side logic without the need for a traditional server.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- A React.js application ready for deployment.
- A Vercel account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).

## Steps to deploy a React.js application on Vercel

1. **Install the Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface)**

   We will use the Vercel CLI to deploy our React.js application. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Build your React.js application**

   Before deploying, we need to build our React.js application. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project. Then, run the following command:

   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```

   This will generate a **build** folder containing the optimized and minified version of your application.

3. **Deploy to Vercel**

   With the Vercel CLI installed and your React.js application built, you can now deploy to Vercel. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```shell
   vercel
   ```

   The CLI will guide you through the deployment process. You will need to provide your Vercel credentials and choose a project name.

4. **Customize your project settings (optional)**

   After the deployment is complete, you can customize your project settings on the Vercel dashboard. You can set custom domains, environment variables, and configure advanced routing options.

## Conclusion

Deploying a React.js application with Vercel is a straightforward and efficient process. By taking advantage of Vercel's serverless deployment capabilities, you can easily scale your application and provide a seamless experience to your users. With its built-in features and global CDN, Vercel is a great choice for hosting your React.js applications.

Give it a try and see how easy it is to deploy your next React.js project using Vercel!
