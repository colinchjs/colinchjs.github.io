`useState` is a hook that allows you to add state to your functional components. It returns a state value and a function to update that value. The basic syntax of `useState` is as follows:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

  // ...
};
```

In the example above, `state` is the current value of the state, and `setState` is a function to update the state. `initialState` is the initial value of the state.

To update the state, you can simply call `setState` with the new value. React will then re-render the component with the updated state. Here's an example of how to update the state using an event handler:

```javascript
const handleClick = () => {
  setState(newValue);
};

// ...

<button onClick={handleClick}>Update State</button>
```

Using `useState` can greatly simplify your code and make it more concise. It eliminates the need to define a separate class component and manage the state using `this.state` and `this.setState`.

By using `useState`, you can take advantage of the functional component's simplicity and still have the ability to manage state effectively.
