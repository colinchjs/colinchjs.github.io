In a React.js application, managing state can become complex as the application grows. Fortunately, there are various state management libraries available, and MobX is one of the popular choices. MobX provides a simple and efficient way to manage the state in your React components. In this article, we will explore how to use MobX for state management in a React.js application.

## What is MobX?

**MobX** is a state management library that utilizes **observable** data structures. It allows you to create observable objects, which hold the state of your application, and easily react to changes in that state. MobX provides a simple and intuitive API for managing state in a reactive manner.

## Getting Started with MobX

To get started with MobX in a React.js application, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Open your project directory in a terminal and run the following command:

```
npm install mobx mobx-react
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start using MobX in your React components.

## Creating Observable State

In MobX, you can create **observable** objects to hold the state of your application. Observable objects are plain JavaScript objects or classes that are decorated with the `@observable` decorator or wrapped using the `observable()` function.

Here's an example of creating an observable object:

```jsx
import { observable } from 'mobx';

class CounterStore {
  @observable count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }

  decrement() {
    this.count--;
  }
}

const counter = new CounterStore();
```

In the example above, we define a `CounterStore` class with an `@observable` property `count`. The `count` property holds the state of our counter. By using MobX's `@observable` decorator, any changes to the `count` property will be automatically tracked by MobX.

## Using Observable State in React Components

To use the observable state in your React components, you need to make the components **observable** using the `@observer` decorator from the `mobx-react` package.

Here's an example of creating a simple React component that uses the `CounterStore` from the previous example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react';

@observer
class Counter extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { count } = counter;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
        <button onClick={() => counter.increment()}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={() => counter.decrement()}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, we use the `@observer` decorator to make the `Counter` component an observer of the `CounterStore`. This means that any changes to the `count` property in the `CounterStore` will automatically trigger a re-render of the `Counter` component.

## Conclusion

MobX simplifies the state management in React.js applications by providing a reactive approach to managing state. With MobX, you can create observable objects to hold the state and easily react to changes in that state. By making your React components observable using the `@observer` decorator, you can effortlessly keep your UI in sync with the state changes. MobX is a powerful tool that can greatly improve your React.js development experience.
