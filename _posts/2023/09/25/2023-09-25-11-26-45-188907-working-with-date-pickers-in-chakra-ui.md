Date pickers are a commonly used component in web applications that allow users to select a date from a calendar. With Chakra UI, a popular React component library, working with date pickers becomes a breeze.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `DatePicker` component from Chakra UI to implement a date picker in a React application.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have Chakra UI installed in your React project. You can follow the [official installation guide](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) to set it up.

Once you have Chakra UI installed, you can import the `DatePicker` component:

```jsx
import { DatePicker } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

## Basic Usage

To use the `DatePicker` component, simply add it to your React component's render method:

```jsx
<DatePicker />
```

This will render a basic date picker component with the current date selected.

## Customization

Chakra UI provides various props to customize the appearance and behavior of the `DatePicker` component. Here are a few examples:

### Selecting a Date

To handle date selection, you can provide an `onChange` prop to the `DatePicker` component. The `onChange` callback will be called with the selected date as a JavaScript Date object. You can then use this value to update your application's state:

```jsx
<DatePicker onChange={(date) => setSelectedDate(date)} />
```

### Setting the Initial Date

If you want to preselect a specific date when the date picker is rendered, you can use the `defaultValue` prop. Pass a JavaScript Date object to the `defaultValue` prop to set the initial selection:

```jsx
<DatePicker defaultValue={new Date("2022-01-01")} />
```

### Customizing the Appearance

Chakra UI provides numerous props to customize the appearance of the `DatePicker` component. You can use props like `size`, `colorScheme`, and `variant` to modify the styling:

```jsx
<DatePicker size="lg" colorScheme="teal" variant="outline" />
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored how to work with date pickers using the `DatePicker` component from Chakra UI. We learned how to install Chakra UI, use the `DatePicker` component in a React application, and customize its behavior and appearance.

Chakra UI provides a comprehensive set of features to make working with date pickers a breeze. By leveraging the power of Chakra UI, you can quickly implement date pickers that match the style of your application and provide a great user experience.
