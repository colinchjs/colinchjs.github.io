Tooltips are a useful UI element that can provide additional information or context when hovering over a particular element. In this blog post, we will discuss how to style tooltips using Chakra UI, a popular React component library.

## Creating a Tooltip Component

First, let's create a Tooltip component using Chakra UI. We can use the `Tooltip` component provided by Chakra UI to handle the tooltip functionality.

```jsx
import { Tooltip } from "@chakra-ui/react";

const CustomTooltip = ({ label, children }) => {
  return (
    <Tooltip label={label} placement="top">
      {children}
    </Tooltip>
  );
};
```

Here, we have created a custom `CustomTooltip` component that takes `label` and `children` as props. The `label` prop represents the tooltip content, and the `children` prop represents the element to which the tooltip will be attached.

## Styling the Tooltip

Now, let's explore how to style the tooltip using Chakra UI's styling capabilities.

```jsx
import { Tooltip, Box } from "@chakra-ui/react";

const CustomTooltip = ({ label, children }) => {
  return (
    <Tooltip label={label} placement="top">
      <Box as="span" color="white" bg="gray.800" px={4} py={2} rounded="md">
        {children}
      </Box>
    </Tooltip>
  );
};
```

In the above example, we have wrapped the `children` element inside a `Box` component to style the tooltip. We have set the background color to `gray.800`, text color to `white`, and added padding and rounded corners to the box. You can customize these styles based on your requirements to match your application's design.

## Conclusion

Styling tooltips with Chakra UI is straightforward and allows you to customize the appearance of tooltips to fit the overall design of your application. With the `Tooltip` component and Chakra UI's styling capabilities, you have full control over the look and feel of tooltips.
