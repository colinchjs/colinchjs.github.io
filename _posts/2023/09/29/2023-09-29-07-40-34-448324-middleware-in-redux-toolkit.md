Middleware plays a crucial role in Redux applications by extending the basic functionality of the Redux store. It intercepts actions before they reach the reducer, allowing you to modify the action, dispatch additional actions, or perform async tasks.

Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of adding middleware to your Redux store by providing the `configureStore` function. Here's an example of how to use middleware in Redux Toolkit:

```javascript
import { configureStore, getDefaultMiddleware } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import logger from "redux-logger";

const middleware = [...getDefaultMiddleware(), logger];

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  middleware,
});
```

In the above code, we import the necessary functions from Redux Toolkit, including `configureStore` and `getDefaultMiddleware`. `getDefaultMiddleware` returns the default set of middleware used by Redux Toolkit, which includes handling of thunks and serializable actions.

Next, we create an array called `middleware` and add the default middleware to it. We can then add any custom middleware we want. In this example, we're using `redux-logger` to log actions and state changes to the console.

Finally, we pass the `middleware` array to the `configureStore` function along with the `rootReducer` for our Redux store. This initializes the store with the specified reducer and middleware.

Adding middleware to your Redux store can provide powerful features like logging, API interactions, or handling side effects. Redux Toolkit makes it easy to include middleware in your application and simplifies the overall setup process.
