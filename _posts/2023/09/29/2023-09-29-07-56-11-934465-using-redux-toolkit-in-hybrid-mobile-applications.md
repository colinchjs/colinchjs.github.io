Hybrid mobile applications are a popular choice for building mobile apps as they allow for code reuse across multiple platforms. To manage the state of a hybrid mobile application, Redux is a commonly used library. Redux Toolkit is a powerful extension of Redux that simplifies and streamlines the process of managing state in your application. In this article, we will explore how to use Redux Toolkit in hybrid mobile applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed in your development environment:

1. Node.js and npm
2. React Native CLI

## Getting Started

First, let's create a new React Native project with the following command:

```shell
npx react-native init MyApp
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd MyApp
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```shell
npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit
```

## Setting up Redux Toolkit

Once the dependencies are installed, we can start setting up Redux Toolkit in our hybrid mobile application. 

1. Create a new directory called `store` inside the root of your project.

2. Inside the `store` directory, create a new file called `index.js`.

3. Open the `index.js` file and import the necessary dependencies:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
```

4. Create a function called `configureAppStore` that will configure and return the Redux store:

```javascript
export function configureAppStore() {
  const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {},
    middleware: [],
  });

  return store;
}
```

In this example, we are initializing the Redux store with an empty reducer and an empty array for middleware.

## Adding Redux Toolkit to your App

Now that our Redux store is configured, we can integrate it into our hybrid mobile application.

1. Open the `App.js` file in the root of your project.

2. Import the `Provider` component from `react-redux` and the `configureAppStore` function we created earlier:

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { configureAppStore } from './store';
```

3. Wrap your root component with the `Provider` component and pass the Redux store as a prop:

```javascript
const store = configureAppStore();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      // Your root component
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

Now, any component within your application can access the Redux store using the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks provided by React Redux.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have explored how to use Redux Toolkit in hybrid mobile applications. With Redux Toolkit, managing the state of your application becomes easier and more efficient. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily integrate Redux Toolkit into your hybrid mobile application and enjoy the benefits of a streamlined state management system.
