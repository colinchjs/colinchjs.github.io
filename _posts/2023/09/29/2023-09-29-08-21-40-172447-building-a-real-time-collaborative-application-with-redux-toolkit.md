In this blog post, we will explore how to build a real-time collaborative application using Redux Toolkit. Redux Toolkit is a powerful library that simplifies and streamlines the process of building Redux applications. It provides a set of opinionated defaults and utilities that helps you write Redux code faster and with less boilerplate.

## Why Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit is a great choice for building real-time collaborative applications because it provides a predictable state management system. It allows us to maintain a single source of truth and easily synchronize the state across different clients in real-time.

## Setting up the project

To get started, let's set up a new React project and install the necessary dependencies:

```javascript
npx create-react-app collaborative-app
cd collaborative-app
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit firebase
```

We will use Firebase as our real-time database and authentication provider. So, make sure you have a Firebase account and create a new project.

## Setting up Firebase

Once you have a Firebase project, let's initialize Firebase in our application. Create a new file `src/firebase.js` and copy the following code:

```javascript
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';
import 'firebase/database';

// Your Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  // ...
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export const auth = firebase.auth();
export const database = firebase.database();
```

Replace the `firebaseConfig` object with your own Firebase configuration, which you can find in your Firebase project settings.

## Creating the Redux store

Next, let's create a Redux store using Redux Toolkit. Create a new file `src/store.js` and copy the following code:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { createWrap } from '@khanacademy/redux-firestore';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

import { database } from './firebase';

const wrap = createWrap({
  firebaseInstance: database,
  enableMultiPaths: true,
});

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  enhancers: [
    wrap,
  ],
});

export default store;
```

Here, we are using `@khanacademy/redux-firestore` to integrate Redux Toolkit with Firebase. It provides a set of middleware and enhancers that allow us to bind our Redux store with Firebase Firestore in an easy and efficient manner.

## Building the application

Now that we have set up the project and the Redux store, let's start building our real-time collaborative application. We can create different components such as `LoginForm`, `Editor`, `DocumentList`, etc., and define the relevant actions and reducers using Redux Toolkit. For brevity, let's skip the details of implementing each component.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have seen how to build a real-time collaborative application using Redux Toolkit. By leveraging the power of Redux and integrating it with Firebase, we can easily manage the state of our application and keep it synchronized in real-time across multiple clients.
