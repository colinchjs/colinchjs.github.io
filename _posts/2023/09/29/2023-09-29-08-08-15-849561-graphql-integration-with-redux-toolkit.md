In modern web development, managing state in client-side applications has become a crucial task. Redux is a popular state management library that provides a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It is widely used in conjunction with React to build complex and scalable applications. However, when it comes to integrating GraphQL, Redux Toolkit provides a streamlined and efficient way to handle GraphQL queries and mutations within your Redux store.

## Why GraphQL with Redux Toolkit?

GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs, allowing clients to request only the data they need. This makes it an excellent choice for fetching data in modern web applications. With Redux Toolkit, you can seamlessly integrate GraphQL queries and mutations within your Redux store, enabling you to manage GraphQL-related state as part of your overall application state.

## Setting up Redux Toolkit with GraphQL

To start using GraphQL with Redux Toolkit, you'll need to configure your Redux store to handle GraphQL operations. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, let's install the required dependencies. You'll need `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `redux-thunk`, and `graphql-request`. You can install them using npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit redux-thunk graphql-request
```

### Step 2: Create a GraphQL API Client

Next, create a GraphQL API client using `graphql-request`. This client will be responsible for sending queries and mutations to the GraphQL server. You can create a separate file, `api.js`, and define your client there:

```javascript
import { GraphQLClient } from 'graphql-request';

const graphQLClient = new GraphQLClient('https://api.example.com/graphql');

export default graphQLClient;
```

### Step 3: Create Slice for GraphQL State

In Redux Toolkit, a slice represents a portion of the Redux store. Create a slice for GraphQL state where you'll store the results of GraphQL queries and mutations:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const graphQLSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'graphql',
  initialState: {
    loading: false,
    error: null,
    data: null,
  },
  reducers: {},
});

export default graphQLSlice.reducer;
```

### Step 4: Create Async Thunks for GraphQL Operations

Create asynchronous thunks for performing GraphQL operations using `createAsyncThunk`, provided by Redux Toolkit. Thunks allow you to write asynchronous code and dispatch actions.

```javascript
import { createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import graphQLClient from './api';

export const fetchUser = createAsyncThunk(
  'graphql/fetchUser',
  async (userId) => {
    const query = `
      query($userId: ID!) {
        user(id: $userId) {
          id
          name
          email
        }
      }
    `;
    const variables = { userId };
    const data = await graphQLClient.request(query, variables);
    return data.user;
  }
);

export const updateUser = createAsyncThunk(
  'graphql/updateUser',
  async (user) => {
    const mutation = `
      mutation($user: UserInput!) {
        updateUser(input: $user) {
          id
          name
          email
        }
      }
    `;
    const variables = { user };
    const data = await graphQLClient.request(mutation, variables);
    return data.updateUser;
  }
);
```

### Step 5: Add GraphQL Slice and Thunks to Redux Store

Finally, add the GraphQL slice and thunks to your Redux store by configuring the store using the `configureStore` function:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import graphQLReducer from './graphqlSlice';
import { fetchUser, updateUser } from './graphqlThunks';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    graphql: graphQLReducer,
  },
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware().concat(fetchUser, updateUser),
});

export default store;
```

## Conclusion

Integrating GraphQL with Redux Toolkit allows you to efficiently manage GraphQL-related state in your Redux store. With the use of slices, thunks, and the convenient integration of `graphql-request`, you can bring the power of GraphQL into your Redux application seamlessly. By adopting this approach, you can build scalable and dynamic web applications using the best of both Redux and GraphQL.
