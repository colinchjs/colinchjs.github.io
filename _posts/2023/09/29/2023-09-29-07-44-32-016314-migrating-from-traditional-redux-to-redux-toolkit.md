As your application grows, managing the state with traditional Redux can become cumbersome and repetitive. Fortunately, Redux Toolkit provides a set of tools and abstractions that simplify the process of managing state in Redux. In this blog post, we will discuss the benefits of migrating from traditional Redux to Redux Toolkit and provide step-by-step guidelines on how to do the migration.

## Why migrate to Redux Toolkit?

1. **Simplified Redux setup**: Redux Toolkit provides a simplified way to set up and configure Redux. It includes preconfigured Redux store, reducer setup, and middleware configuration, reducing the boilerplate code required to get started with Redux.

2. **Improved developer experience**: Redux Toolkit provides several utility functions and shorthand syntaxes that improve the developer experience. It eliminates the need to write repetitive and verbose code, making the codebase more readable and maintainable.

3. **Built-in best practices**: Redux Toolkit incorporates recommended best practices for Redux development, such as using immer for immutability and creating **slices** to manage state in a modular way. These best practices help ensure a cleaner and more efficient codebase.

## Migration process

Before starting the migration process, backup your code and ensure that you have a good understanding of traditional Redux concepts and how Redux Toolkit works.

1. **Install Redux Toolkit**: Begin by installing Redux Toolkit package into your project. Use the following command:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

2. **Create a slice**: Identify an existing reducer in your codebase that you want to migrate. Start by creating a new file for your slice, following a naming convention such as `someSlice.js`. In this file, import the necessary functions from Redux Toolkit and use the `createSlice` function to define your slice. Inside the `createSlice` function, define the name, initialState, and reducers for your slice.

Example code:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const someSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'some',
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {
    // define reducers here
  },
});

export const { actions, reducer } = someSlice;
```

3. **Update your store**: In your Redux store file, import the newly created slice and add it to the combineReducers function. Replace the old reducer with the new one from the slice.

Example code:

```javascript
import { configureStore, combineReducers } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { reducer as someReducer } from './someSlice';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  some: someReducer,
  // other reducers
});

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  // configure other store options
});

export default store;
```

4. **Update action creators**: In your action creator files, replace the old action creators and action types with the auto-generated action creators from the slice. You can import the `actions` object from the slice and use it to dispatch actions.

Example code:

```javascript
import { actions } from './someSlice';

...

dispatch(actions.someAction(payload));
```

5. **Refactor reducers**: Update your old reducers to use the **immer** library provided by Redux Toolkit. Replace the manual immutable updates with a more straightforward and intuitive syntax.

Example code:

```javascript
import { produce } from 'immer';

...

const someReducer = produce((state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'someAction':
      // update the state here
      break;
    // other cases
  }
}, initialState);
```

6. **Repeat for other reducers**: Follow the same steps for other reducers in your application, gradually migrating them to Redux Toolkit slices.

7. **Test and verify**: After migrating each slice, thoroughly test your application to ensure that everything is working as expected. Verify that the state management remains intact and the application's behavior is unchanged.

## Conclusion

Migrating from traditional Redux to Redux Toolkit can greatly improve your development experience and enhance the maintainability of your codebase. With simplified setup, improved developer experience, and built-in best practices, Redux Toolkit offers a more efficient way to manage state in Redux. By following the step-by-step guidelines provided in this blog post, you can successfully migrate your application to Redux Toolkit and reap the benefits it provides.
