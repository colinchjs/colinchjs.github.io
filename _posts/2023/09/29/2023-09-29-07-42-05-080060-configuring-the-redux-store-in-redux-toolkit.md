When using Redux Toolkit, configuring the Redux store becomes much simpler and more streamlined compared to the traditional Redux approach. Redux Toolkit provides a set of opinionated defaults and simplifies various Redux concepts and features, making it a great choice for building scalable and maintainable React applications.

In this blog post, we will explore how to configure the Redux store using Redux Toolkit. Let's dive in!

## Step 1: Installing Redux Toolkit

Before we start, make sure to have Redux Toolkit installed in your project. You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

or if you are using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
```

## Step 2: Creating the Redux Store

To create the Redux store using Redux Toolkit, we first need to import `configureStore` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`.

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
```

Next, we can define our Redux store using the `configureStore` function. This function accepts an object parameter where we define our reducers, middleware, and other store configurations.

```javascript
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    // reducers go here
  },
  middleware: [],
});
```

In the above example, we pass an empty array to the `middleware` key, indicating that we are not using any middleware at the moment. You can add middleware like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga` here depending on your requirements.

## Step 3: Combining Reducers

To use multiple reducers in our Redux store, we need to combine them using the `combineReducers` function from Redux Toolkit.

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
```

We can define all our reducers in separate files and import them into a root reducer file. Then, we can use the `combineReducers` function to combine them.

```javascript
import reducer1 from './reducer1';
import reducer2 from './reducer2';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  reducer1,
  reducer2,
});
```

In the above example, `reducer1` and `reducer2` are reducers defined in separate files. By combining them, we create a single root reducer that can be passed to the `configureStore` function.

## Step 4: Adding DevTools Extension

To enable the use of Redux DevTools extension, we can modify our `configureStore` setup as follows:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  middleware: [],
  devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
});
```

In the above example, we enable the Redux DevTools extension only in development mode. This way, the extension will not impact the performance of our production build.

## Step 5: Exporting the Redux Store

Once we have configured the Redux store using Redux Toolkit, we need to export it from our file so that it can be accessed by other components in our application.

```javascript
export default store;
```

## Conclusion

By using Redux Toolkit, configuring the Redux store becomes much easier and less error-prone. It provides an intuitive API for configuring the store, combining reducers, and enabling Redux DevTools extension. With Redux Toolkit, you can focus more on writing application logic rather than spending time on Redux setup.
