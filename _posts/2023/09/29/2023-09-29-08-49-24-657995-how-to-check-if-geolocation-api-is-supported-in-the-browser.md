The Geolocation API provides a way for web applications to request the user's location information. However, not all browsers and devices support this API. Therefore, before using the Geolocation API, it's important to check if it is supported by the user's browser.

To check if the Geolocation API is supported, you can use a simple JavaScript function that checks for the existence of the `navigator.geolocation` object. Here's an example code that demonstrates how to perform this check:

```javascript
function checkGeolocationSupport() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    // Geolocation API is supported
    console.log("Geolocation is supported!");
    // You can proceed with using the Geolocation API here
  } else {
    // Geolocation API is not supported
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported!");
    // Handle the lack of Geolocation support gracefully
  }
}

// Call the checkGeolocationSupport function
checkGeolocationSupport();
```

In the code above, we define a function called `checkGeolocationSupport()`, which checks if the `navigator.geolocation` object exists. If it does, it means that the Geolocation API is supported, and we can proceed with using it. However, if the object doesn't exist, it means that the Geolocation API is not supported, and we should handle this situation gracefully.

You can place this code in your web application's JavaScript file or in a script tag in your HTML document. By calling the `checkGeolocationSupport()` function, you can determine whether the Geolocation API is supported in the user's browser.

Remember to test your code in different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and provide fallback options for browsers that do not support the Geolocation API.
