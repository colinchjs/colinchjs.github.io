Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique that allows rendering web pages on the server before sending them to the client. This approach provides several benefits, including improved performance, better SEO, and enhanced user experience. In this blog post, we'll explore how to implement SSR using Immer and Nuxt.js.

## What is Immer?

Immer is an immutable state management library for JavaScript that allows you to work with immutable data structures in a more convenient way. It provides a simple API to create copies of your state with modifications, while keeping the original object unchanged. Immer's approach reduces the complexity of dealing with immutable state, making it easier to implement SSR.

## What is Nuxt.js?

Nuxt.js is a powerful framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) Vue.js applications. It provides out-of-the-box support for SSR, routing, and code-splitting, making it a great choice for implementing SSR with Immer.

## Getting started with Immer and Nuxt.js

To get started, first create a new Nuxt.js project by running the following command:

```bash
npx create-nuxt-app my-app
```

Answer the prompts to configure your project according to your needs. Once the project has been created, navigate to the project directory and install the Immer package:

```bash
npm install immer
```

Next, open the `nuxt.config.js` file and add Immer to the build modules:

```javascript
// nuxt.config.js
export default {
  buildModules: [
    'nuxt-vite',
    'nuxt-windicss',
    'immer/nuxt'
  ]
}
```

Create a new Vuex store file (`store/index.js`), and import Immer and create a reducer function:

```javascript
// store/index.js
import { createReducer } from 'immer'

export const state = () => ({
  counter: 0
})

export const mutations = {
  increment(state) {
    state.counter++
  }
}

export const reducer = () =>
  createReducer(state(), (draft, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'increment':
        draft.counter++
        break
    }
  })
```

In your Vue components, use the `useImmer` hook to handle state mutations:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
    <p>Counter: {{ counter }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { useImmer } from 'vue-immer'
import { useStore } from 'vuex'

export default {
  setup() {
    const store = useStore()
    const { counter } = useImmer(store.state, store.commit)

    const increment = () => {
      store.commit('increment')
    }

    return { counter, increment }
  }
}
</script>
```

Finally, start your Nuxt.js server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have explored how to implement server-side rendering (SSR) with Immer and Nuxt.js. By combining the power of Immer's immutable state management with Nuxt.js's SSR capabilities, you can enhance the performance and user experience of your Vue.js applications. Happy coding!
