Handling dates and times in Redux Toolkit can sometimes be a bit tricky, especially when you need to manage time zones, manipulate dates, or format them in a user-friendly way. In this blog post, we will discuss some common scenarios and provide guidance on how to handle dates and times effectively in Redux Toolkit.

## Storing Dates in Redux Store

When storing dates in Redux store, it's recommended to use the JavaScript `Date` object or a library like `moment.js` to ensure consistency and ease of manipulation. For example, consider the scenario where you have a `post` object with a `createdAt` field representing the creation timestamp:

```javascript
const post = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'My First Blog Post',
  createdAt: new Date(),
};
```

By using the `Date` object, you can easily compare, format, and perform calculations on the date within your Redux reducers and selectors.

## Manipulating Dates

Redux Toolkit provides convenient methods for updating dates in your Redux store. For instance, let's say you want to update the `createdAt` field of a `post` object to the current date:

```javascript
const updatedPost = {
  ...post,
  createdAt: new Date(),
};
```

You can then dispatch an action to update the `post` object in your Redux store:

```javascript
dispatch(updatePost(updatedPost));
```

Using the `Date` object allows you to easily modify any part of the date or time, such as adding or subtracting days, hours, minutes, etc.

## Formatting Dates for Display

When displaying dates in your application, it's important to consider the user's locale and preferences. Redux Toolkit provides a powerful library called `react-intl` which allows you to format dates and times according to localized rules and preferences.

First, install the `react-intl` package:

```shell
npm install react-intl
```

Next, you can use the `FormattedDate` component from `react-intl` to format your dates in a user-friendly way within your React components:

```jsx
import { FormattedDate } from 'react-intl';

const MyComponent = ({ date }) => (
  <p>
    Created at: <FormattedDate value={date} />  
  </p>
);
```

This will automatically format the `date` according to the user's locale and display it in a human-readable format.

## Conclusion

Working with dates and times in Redux Toolkit doesn't have to be complicated. By using the `Date` object or libraries like `moment.js` in your Redux store, manipulating dates becomes straightforward and efficient. Additionally, utilizing the `react-intl` library allows for easy localization and formatting of dates for display.
