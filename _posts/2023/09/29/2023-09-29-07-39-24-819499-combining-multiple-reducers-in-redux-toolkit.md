In Redux Toolkit, combining multiple reducers is a common task when working with larger and more complex applications. By combining reducers, you can manage different parts of your application state in a modular and maintainable way.

## What is a Reducer?

A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state based on the action. In Redux Toolkit, reducers are created using the `createSlice` or `createReducer` functions.

## Why Combine Reducers?

As your application grows, you might find it necessary to organize your state into multiple smaller reducers. Each reducer can handle a specific part of the state, making it easier to manage and test.

Combining reducers allows you to merge these smaller reducers into a single reducer, which can then be passed to the Redux store. This ensures that each individual reducer correctly manages its own portion of the application state, while still working together seamlessly.

## Combining Reducers with Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit provides a convenient utility function called `combineReducers` that makes it easy to combine multiple reducers into one. Here's how you can use it:

```javascript
import { combineReducers, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from './counterSlice';
import todosReducer from './todosSlice';

// Combine multiple reducers
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterReducer,
  todos: todosReducer,
});

// Create the Redux store with the combined reducer
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
});

export default store;
```

In the example above, we have two separate reducers: `counterReducer` and `todosReducer`. By using the `combineReducers` function, we can merge them into a single reducer called `rootReducer`. This combined reducer is then passed to the `configureStore` function to create the Redux store.

## Conclusion

Combining multiple reducers in Redux Toolkit is a straightforward process that allows you to manage your application state in a modular and scalable way. By organizing your state into smaller reducers and combining them using the `combineReducers` function, you can maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.
