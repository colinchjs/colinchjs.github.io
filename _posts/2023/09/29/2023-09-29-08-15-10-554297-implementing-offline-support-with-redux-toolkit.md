In today's connected world, it's essential for applications to provide a seamless user experience, even in offline mode. With Redux Toolkit, you can easily implement offline support in your application. In this blog post, we'll explore how to achieve this using Redux Toolkit.

## Why offline support?

Offline support allows users to continue using your application even when they don't have an internet connection. This can greatly enhance the user experience and improve productivity. It also ensures that data is not lost when the connection is lost temporarily.

## Setting up offline support with Redux Toolkit

To implement offline support, we'll be using the [`redux-persist`](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) library, which is fully compatible with Redux Toolkit.

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install redux-persist
   ```

2. Create a new file called `offlineConfig.js` and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   import storage from 'redux-persist/lib/storage';
   import { persistStore, persistReducer } from 'redux-persist';

   const persistConfig = {
     key: 'root',
     storage
   };

   export const persistorConfig = (store) => persistStore(store, persistConfig);
   export const persistedReducer = (reducer) => persistReducer(persistConfig, reducer);
   ```

3. Modify your Redux store setup by importing the `persistorConfig` and `persistedReducer` functions from `offlineConfig.js`:

   ```javascript
   import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
   import { persistorConfig, persistedReducer } from './offlineConfig';
   import rootReducer from './reducers';

   const store = configureStore({
     reducer: persistedReducer(rootReducer)
   });

   export default {
     store,
     persistor: persistorConfig(store)
   };
   ```

4. Finally, wrap your application component with a `PersistGate` component from `redux-persist` in your root component file:

   ```javascript
   import { PersistGate } from 'redux-persist/integration/react';
   import { persistor } from './store';

   ReactDOM.render(
     <Provider store={store}>
       <PersistGate loading={null} persistor={persistor}>
         <App />
       </PersistGate>
     </Provider>,
     document.getElementById('root')
   );
   ```

That's it! With these steps, you've successfully added offline support to your React application using Redux Toolkit.

## Conclusion

Implementing offline support is crucial for modern web applications. With Redux Toolkit's integration with `redux-persist`, it becomes easier than ever to achieve this. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can provide a seamless user experience even when your users are offline.
