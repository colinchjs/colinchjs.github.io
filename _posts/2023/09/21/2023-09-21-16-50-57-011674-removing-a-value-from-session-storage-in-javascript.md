In JavaScript, session storage provides a way to store key-value pairs, similar to the functionality of cookies. The main difference is that session storage data is only available during the current browser session and is not persisted when the browser is closed.

To remove a value from session storage, you can use the `removeItem()` method. This method takes the key of the item you want to remove as a parameter and deletes it from session storage.

Here's an example of how to remove a value from session storage in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Remove a value from session storage
sessionStorage.removeItem('keyName');
```

In the code above, replace `'keyName'` with the key of the value you want to remove. This will remove the specified key-value pair from the session storage.

It's important to note that if you try to remove a key that doesn't exist in session storage, it will not throw an error. It will simply do nothing and continue executing the code.

You can also clear all the values from session storage using the `clear()` method. This method removes all the key-value pairs from session storage, effectively resetting it.

```javascript
// Clear all values from session storage
sessionStorage.clear();
```

Remember to use session storage carefully and only store necessary data, as it is limited to the amount of data that can be stored in the user's browser.
