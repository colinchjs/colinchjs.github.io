In modern web applications, authentication is a critical aspect of ensuring the security of user data. When a user logs in, an authentication token is typically generated, which is then used to authenticate subsequent requests made by the user.

One common approach to storing authentication tokens on the client-side is by using session storage in JavaScript. Session storage provides a way to store key-value pairs specific to a particular session, which remains available as long as the browser tab or window is open.

## Storing the Authentication Token

To store an authentication token in session storage, you can use the `setItem` method provided by the `sessionStorage` object. Let's assume that after successful login, you have obtained an authentication token named `accessToken`. Here's an example of how you can store it in the session storage:

```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem('authToken', accessToken);
```

This code snippet stores the `accessToken` in session storage with the key `'authToken'`. It is important to choose a key that is relevant to your application.

## Retrieving the Authentication Token

To retrieve the authentication token from session storage, you can use the `getItem` method provided by the `sessionStorage` object. Here's an example:

```javascript
const authToken = sessionStorage.getItem('authToken');
```

This code snippet retrieves the value associated with the key `'authToken'` from the session storage and assigns it to the `authToken` variable.

## Clearing the Authentication Token

In certain scenarios, you may need to clear the stored authentication token, such as when a user logs out. To remove the stored authentication token from session storage, you can use the `removeItem` method provided by the `sessionStorage` object. Here's an example:

```javascript
sessionStorage.removeItem('authToken');
```

The code snippet above removes the key-value pair associated with the key `'authToken'` from the session storage.

## Conclusion

Using session storage to store authentication tokens in JavaScript provides a convenient way to manage user authentication in web applications. By utilizing the `setItem`, `getItem`, and `removeItem` methods provided by the `sessionStorage` object, you can easily store, retrieve, and clear authentication tokens. This approach helps maintain the security of user data and enhances the overall user experience.
