In recent years, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has become increasingly popular among businesses looking to automate repetitive tasks and streamline their operations. RPA uses software robots or "bots" to mimic human actions and interact with different systems and applications. 

To deploy RPA applications efficiently, developers can leverage Docker and Javascript. Docker allows for containerization of applications, making it easier to manage dependencies and ensure consistent deployment across different environments. Javascript, on the other hand, provides a versatile and widely supported language for developing RPA bots.

## Setting up the Environment

Before diving into the details, let's start by setting up our development environment. Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine. Additionally, install Node.js and NPM to work with Javascript and its libraries effectively.

## Creating the RPA Application

1. **Initialize the project**: Start by creating a new directory for your project and navigating to it using the command line. Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

   ```shell
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: To enable RPA capabilities in our application, we can use the *puppeteer* library, which provides a high-level API for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium. Install it by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install puppeteer
   ```

3. **Write the application code**: Create a new Javascript file, e.g., `rpa.js`, and add the following code snippet as an example:

   ```javascript
   const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

   (async () => {
     const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
     const page = await browser.newPage();
     await page.goto('https://www.example.com');
     await page.screenshot({ path: 'example.png' });
     await browser.close();
   })();
   ```

   The above code uses puppeteer to launch a headless browser, navigate to a web page, take a screenshot, and then close the browser instance.

4. **Test the application**: Run the script using the following command:

   ```shell
   node rpa.js
   ```

   If everything works as expected, you should see a screenshot saved as `example.png`.

## Containerizing the RPA Application using Docker

Now that we have our RPA application working locally, let's containerize it using Docker to ensure consistent deployment across different environments.

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: In your project directory, create a new file named `Dockerfile` (without any extension) and add the following lines:

   ```docker
   FROM node:14

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY package.json .
   RUN npm install

   COPY . .

   CMD ["node", "rpa.js"]
   ```

   The Dockerfile defines the base image, sets the working directory, copies the package.json file, installs dependencies, copies the entire project directory, and specifies the command to run the application.

2. **Build the Docker image**: Open the command line, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to build the Docker image:

   ```shell
   docker build -t rpa-app .
   ```

   This command builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` and tags it with the name `rpa-app`.

3. **Run the Docker container**: After the Docker image is built, you can run a container using the following command:

   ```shell
   docker run rpa-app
   ```

   The command starts a container based on the `rpa-app` image, running the RPA application inside it.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to deploy RPA applications using Docker and Javascript. By combining Docker's containerization capabilities with the versatility of Javascript, developers can easily package and deploy RPA applications across different environments.

By using Docker, you ensure consistent deployments and eliminate potential dependency issues. And with Javascript and libraries like puppeteer, you can create powerful bots capable of automating a wide range of tasks.
