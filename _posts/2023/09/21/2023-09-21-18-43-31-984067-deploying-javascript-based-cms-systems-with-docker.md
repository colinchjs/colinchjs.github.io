In today's tech-driven world, content management systems (CMS) play a crucial role in enabling businesses to manage and deliver their content effectively. With the rise in popularity of Javascript-based CMS systems like **Strapi** and **KeystoneJS**, it's essential to have a streamlined deployment process to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.

One powerful tool that can simplify the deployment process is **Docker**, a platform that allows you to build, package, and distribute applications as containers. Docker containers provide standardization, isolation, and portability, making it easier to deploy and manage complex applications.

## Why use Docker for deploying CMS systems

**Easy Setup and Portability**: Docker containers encapsulate all the necessary dependencies, including the CMS system and its associated libraries, making it easy to set up and deploy on different environments. It eliminates the hassle of manual dependency installation and configuration, thereby saving time and effort.

**Isolation and Security**: Docker containers provide isolation between the application and the host system, ensuring that the CMS system runs securely without any interference from other services or applications on the host. It helps in preventing conflicts and allows for better control over resources.

**Scalability**: Docker's containerization approach makes it straightforward to scale CMS systems horizontally by spinning up multiple containers to handle increased traffic or workload. This scalability is beneficial for high-traffic websites and content-heavy applications.

**Version Control**: Docker provides version control capabilities, allowing you to tag and track different versions of the CMS system. It enables easy rollbacks, seamless updates, and testing of different versions simultaneously without affecting the stability of the live environment.

## Deploying a Javascript-based CMS system with Docker

Let's walk through a simple example of deploying a Javascript-based CMS system, specifically Strapi, using Docker.

### Step 1: Install Docker

First, ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker according to your operating system from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your Strapi project. This file will define the specifications and instructions for building the Docker image.

```dockerfile
# Use a Node.js base image with a specific version
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the entire Strapi project
COPY . .

# Build the Strapi project
RUN npm run build

# Expose the desired port (e.g., 1337)
EXPOSE 1337

# Set the container's start command
CMD [ "npm", "run", "start" ]
```

### Step 3: Build the Docker image

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```shell
docker build -t strapi .
```

This command instructs Docker to build an image named "strapi" using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory. The `-t` flag allows you to tag the image for easy reference.

### Step 4: Run the Docker container

Once the image has been built, you can run a Docker container based on that image using the following command:

```shell
docker run -p 1337:1337 strapi
```

This command spins up a Docker container named "strapi" and maps port 1337 of the host machine to port 1337 of the container. Adjust the port numbers as per your CMS system's configuration.

### Step 5: Access the CMS system

You can now access your deployed Strapi CMS system by opening a browser and navigating to `http://localhost:1337` (assuming you used port 1337 in the previous step). Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your Strapi instance and start managing your content.

## Conclusion

Deploying Javascript-based CMS systems like Strapi and KeystoneJS using Docker can greatly simplify the deployment process, enhance portability, and provide scalability and security. Docker's containerization approach ensures that your CMS system runs consistently across different environments, giving you more control and agility in managing your content. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can confidently deploy your Javascript-based CMS system with Docker and leverage its advantages for your business success.
