Autocomplete functionality is a useful feature in web applications that provides suggestions to users as they type in input fields. When working with autocomplete suggestions that are specific to each user, we need a way to persist and retrieve the suggestions across multiple page loads or sessions. One approach to accomplish this is by using the `sessionStorage` object in JavaScript.

### What is Session Storage?

`sessionStorage` is a type of web storage that allows data to be stored and accessed during a browser session. Unlike `localStorage`, which persists data even after the browser is closed, `sessionStorage` stores data only for the duration of the session. This data is specific to a particular tab or window and is not shared across different tabs or windows.

### Storing Autocomplete Suggestions in Session Storage

To store and manage user-specific autocomplete suggestions using `sessionStorage`, we can follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the current user's suggestions from `sessionStorage` at the start of the session. If no suggestions exist, initialize an empty array.

```javascript
const suggestions = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('autocompleteSuggestions')) || [];
```

2. Whenever the user interacts with the autocomplete feature and new suggestions are generated, append them to the existing suggestions array.

```javascript
const newSuggestions = generateNewSuggestions(); // Example function to generate new suggestions
suggestions.push(...newSuggestions);
```

3. Store the updated suggestions array back to `sessionStorage`.

```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem('autocompleteSuggestions', JSON.stringify(suggestions));
```

### Retrieving Autocomplete Suggestions from Session Storage

To retrieve the stored autocomplete suggestions from `sessionStorage` and use them in subsequent sessions, we can follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the stored suggestions from `sessionStorage` at the start of a session, just like when storing the suggestions.

```javascript
const suggestions = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('autocompleteSuggestions')) || [];
```

2. Use the retrieved suggestions in the autocomplete functionality of your application.

```javascript
// Example function to populate suggestions in an autocomplete input field
function populateSuggestions() {
    const inputField = document.getElementById('autocompleteInput');
    inputField.addEventListener('input', () => {
        const userInput = inputField.value.toLowerCase();
        const filteredSuggestions = suggestions.filter(suggestion => suggestion.includes(userInput));
        // Populate the UI with the filtered suggestions
    });
}
```

### Summary

By using `sessionStorage` in JavaScript, it becomes easy to manage and persist user-specific autocomplete suggestions across sessions. Storing the suggestions in session storage ensures that each user gets their own personalized autocomplete suggestions without interfering with other users' suggestions. This technique can enhance the usability and user experience of your web application.
