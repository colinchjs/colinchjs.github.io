## What is session storage?
Session storage is a part of the Web Storage API, which provides a way to store key-value pairs in a web browser. Unlike local storage, which persists even after the browser is closed, session storage only retains data for the duration of the browser session.

## Storing user preferences
To store user preferences using session storage, you can use the `setItem()` method provided by the `sessionStorage` object. This method takes two arguments: the key and the value.

```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
sessionStorage.setItem('fontSize', '16px');
```

In the example above, we are storing two preferences: the theme (dark) and the font size (16px). The key-value pairs are saved in the session storage.

## Retrieving user preferences
To retrieve the stored preferences, you can use the `getItem()` method provided by the `sessionStorage` object. This method takes the key as an argument and returns the corresponding value.

```javascript
const themePreference = sessionStorage.getItem('theme');
const fontSizePreference = sessionStorage.getItem('fontSize');
```
In the example above, we are retrieving the theme and font size preferences from the session storage.

## Removing user preferences
If you want to remove a preference from the session storage, you can use the `removeItem()` method provided by the `sessionStorage` object. This method takes the key as an argument and removes the corresponding key-value pair.

```javascript
sessionStorage.removeItem('theme');
```

In the example above, we are removing the theme preference from the session storage.

## Conclusion
Session storage provides a simple and efficient way to store and manage user preferences in JavaScript applications. By using the `setItem()`, `getItem()`, and `removeItem()` methods provided by the `sessionStorage` object, you can easily store, retrieve and remove user preferences within the scope of a browser session.

With session storage, you can deliver personalized experiences to your users by remembering their preferences until they close their browser. #JavaScript #SessionStorage
