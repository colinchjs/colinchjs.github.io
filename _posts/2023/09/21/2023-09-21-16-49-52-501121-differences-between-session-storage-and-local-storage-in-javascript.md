In JavaScript, both **Session Storage** and **Local Storage** are client-side web storage mechanisms that allow developers to store key-value pairs. While they serve a similar purpose, there are some important differences between the two.

## Session Storage

Session Storage is a mechanism for storing data on the client side that lasts only for the duration of the browser session. It means that the stored data will *persist only as long as the browser tab or window is open*. Once the browser session is closed or the tab is closed, the session storage data is cleared.

**Usage**:

```javascript
// Storing data in session storage
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");

// Retrieving data from session storage
var data = sessionStorage.getItem("key");

// Removing data from session storage
sessionStorage.removeItem("key");
```

Some important characteristics of session storage are:

1. **Scoping**: Session storage is associated with the specific browser tab or window. Data stored in one tab or window is not accessible from another tab or window.

2. **Data Storage Limit**: Usually, the session storage limit is around 5MB per domain, but it may vary between browsers.

3. **Storage Lifecycle**: Data in session storage is cleared when the browser session ends or when the user explicitly clears the storage.

## Local Storage

Local Storage, on the other hand, is a mechanism for storing data on the client side that persists beyond the browser session. The stored data will *persist even when the browser is closed and reopened*. It means that the data stored in local storage will be available across different browser sessions.

**Usage**:

```javascript
// Storing data in local storage
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");

// Retrieving data from local storage
var data = localStorage.getItem("key");

// Removing data from local storage
localStorage.removeItem("key");
```

Here are some important characteristics of local storage:

1. **Scoping**: Local storage is associated with the specific domain and is accessible across multiple browser tabs or windows of that domain.

2. **Data Storage Limit**: Usually, the local storage limit is around 5-10MB per domain, but it may vary between browsers.

3. **Storage Lifecycle**: Data in local storage persists until it is manually cleared by the user or through code.

## When to Use Session Storage or Local Storage?

The choice between session storage and local storage depends on the specific requirements of your application. Use session storage when you need to store temporary data that needs to be available only for the current browser session. On the other hand, use local storage when you need to store data that needs to persist across browser sessions.

It is important to note that both session storage and local storage are specific to the browser in which they are set. They are not accessible by the server, so they should not be used for storing sensitive or critical data.
