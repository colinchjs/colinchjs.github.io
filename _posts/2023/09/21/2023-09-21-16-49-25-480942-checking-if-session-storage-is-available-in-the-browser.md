Session storage is a web API that allows developers to store data in the user's browser, specifically for that session. It provides a way to persist data across different pages of a website until the user closes the browser or the session expires. However, not all browsers support session storage, so it's important to check if it is available before using it.

Here is an example code snippet to check if session storage is available in the browser:

```javascript
if (typeof sessionStorage !== "undefined") {
    // Session storage is available
    console.log("Session storage is supported");
} else {
    // Session storage is not available
    console.log("Session storage is not supported");
}
```

In the example above, we use the `typeof` operator to check if the `sessionStorage` object is defined in the global scope. If it is defined, it means that session storage is available in the browser. If it is not defined, it means that session storage is not supported.

By performing this check, you can ensure that your code gracefully handles scenarios where session storage is not available, preventing any runtime errors. Remember to always consider fallback options or alternative approaches in case session storage is not supported.

It is a good practice to check for feature availability in the browser before using it, as it helps ensure compatibility across different environments and provides a better user experience.
