When building web applications that require user authentication or authorization, it's common to use access tokens to grant access to specific resources or actions. In JavaScript, one way to store these access tokens securely without exposing them to potential security risks is by utilizing the **Session Storage** object.

## Understanding Session Storage

Session Storage is a web storage object that stores key-value pairs in a web browser. It provides a way to store data that remains available as long as the browser session is active. Unlike **Local Storage**, data stored in Session Storage is cleared when the user closes the browser or tab.

## Storing User Access Tokens

To store a user access token in Session Storage, you can use the following steps:

1. Retrieve the access token after a successful login or when it is generated by your authentication system.

2. Use the `sessionStorage.setItem()` method to store the access token in Session Storage. This method takes two parameters: the key and the value to be stored. For example:

```javascript
const accessToken = "your-access-token";
sessionStorage.setItem("userAccessToken", accessToken);
```

3. To retrieve the access token later, you can use the `sessionStorage.getItem()` method, passing the corresponding key. For example:

```javascript
const storedAccessToken = sessionStorage.getItem("userAccessToken");
```

## Checking for Access Token Existence

To check if an access token exists in Session Storage, use the `sessionStorage.getItem()` method and validate the return value:

```javascript
const storedAccessToken = sessionStorage.getItem("userAccessToken");
if (storedAccessToken) {
  // Access token exists, perform necessary actions
} else {
  // Access token does not exist, prompt user to log in or handle accordingly
}
```

## Clearing User Access Token

To clear the user access token from Session Storage, you can use the `sessionStorage.removeItem()` method and specify the key of the access token to remove:

```javascript
sessionStorage.removeItem("userAccessToken");
```

## Conclusion

Using Session Storage for storing user access tokens in JavaScript provides a secure and convenient method to handle user authentication and authorization. With session storage, you can store sensitive information like access tokens during the user session and access them as needed. Always remember to handle access token storage and retrieval with caution to ensure the security and privacy of your users.
