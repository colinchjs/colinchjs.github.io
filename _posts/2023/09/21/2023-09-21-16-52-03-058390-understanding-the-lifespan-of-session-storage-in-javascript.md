When working with web applications, it's common to use session storage to store temporary data that needs to be persisted across different pages or tabs within a browser session. In JavaScript, session storage provides a way to store key-value pairs that will be available as long as the browser session is active. But have you ever wondered about the lifespan of session storage? How long does the data actually persist?

## What is session storage?
Session storage is a web storage API provided by modern browsers that allows developers to store data in the form of key-value pairs within the client's browser session. The data stored in session storage remains available across different pages or tabs in the same browser session, but is cleared once the session ends.

## Lifespan of session storage
The lifespan of session storage is tied to the duration of the browser session. When a user opens a new tab or window, a new session is created, and this session will exist until the user closes the browser or the session expires due to inactivity.

In practical terms, what this means is that data stored in session storage will be available as long as the user keeps the browser open. Once the browser is closed or the session expires, all data stored in session storage is automatically cleared and cannot be accessed anymore.

It's important to note that session storage is not shared among multiple browser sessions. Each session has its own isolated session storage, which means that data stored in one session will not be available in another session, even if they are open in the same browser.

## Using session storage
Using session storage is straightforward in JavaScript. You can use the `sessionStorage` object to access the session storage and its methods. Here's an example of storing and retrieving data:

```javascript
// Storing data in session storage
sessionStorage.setItem('username', 'John Doe');

// Retrieving data from session storage
const username = sessionStorage.getItem('username');
console.log(username); // "John Doe"
```

In this example, we store a username in session storage using the `setItem` method and retrieve it using the `getItem` method.

## Conclusion
Session storage is a handy tool for storing temporary data across different pages or tabs within a browser session. However, it's important to remember that the lifespan of session storage is tied to the duration of the browser session. Understanding this lifespan will help you make the best use of session storage in your web applications.
