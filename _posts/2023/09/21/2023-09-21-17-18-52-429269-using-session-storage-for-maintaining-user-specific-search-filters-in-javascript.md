When building a web application that involves filtering data based on user preferences or search criteria, it is important to provide a seamless experience for users by remembering their filter settings across different pages or sessions. One commonly used method for achieving this is by using session storage in JavaScript.

## What is Session Storage?

Session storage is a web storage API that allows you to persist key-value pairs on the client-side for the duration of a user's session. The data stored in session storage is available only within the same origin and is cleared when the session ends.

## Storing User Filters in Session Storage

To store user-specific search filters using the session storage, you can follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the filter values set by the user.
2. Convert the filter values into a JSON string to ensure compatibility with session storage.
3. Store the JSON string in session storage.

Here's an example code snippet demonstrating how to store and retrieve user filters using session storage in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Step 1: Retrieve the filter values set by the user
const filters = {
  category: 'electronics',
  price: {
    min: 100,
    max: 500
  },
  rating: 4
};

// Step 2: Convert filter values into JSON string
const filtersString = JSON.stringify(filters);

// Step 3: Store the JSON string in session storage
sessionStorage.setItem('userFilters', filtersString);
```

## Retrieving User Filters from Session Storage

To retrieve the user-specific search filters stored in the session storage, follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the JSON string from the session storage.
2. Convert the JSON string back into an object.
3. Use the filter values to populate the search form or apply the filters to the data.

Here's an example code snippet demonstrating how to retrieve and use the user filters from session storage:

```javascript
// Step 1: Retrieve the JSON string from session storage
const filtersString = sessionStorage.getItem('userFilters');

// Step 2: Convert the JSON string back into an object
const filters = JSON.parse(filtersString);

// Step 3: Use the filter values for further processing
console.log(filters.category); // Output: 'electronics'
console.log(filters.price.min); // Output: 100
console.log(filters.price.max); // Output: 500
console.log(filters.rating); // Output: 4
```

By using session storage to store user-specific search filters, you can provide a more personalized experience to your users. They won't have to reapply their filter settings every time they navigate to a different page or refresh the page.

Remember to handle cases where the user doesn't have any previously set filters or when they explicitly clear their filters by removing the corresponding session storage item.
