Ever wondered how to implement session timeout functionality in your JavaScript application? It's important to have a mechanism in place to automatically log out users after a period of inactivity to ensure their account security. In this blog post, we'll walk through how to achieve session timeout functionality using session storage in JavaScript.

## What is Session Storage?

Session storage is a web storage mechanism available in modern browsers that allows storing key-value pairs in the client's browser. The data stored with session storage is only accessible within the same browser tab or window and is cleared when the tab or window is closed.

## Implementing Session Timeout with Session Storage

To implement session timeout functionality using session storage, we can follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Define the session timeout duration - the time of inactivity after which a user will be automatically logged out.

```javascript
const SESSION_TIMEOUT = 300000; // 5 minutes (in milliseconds)
```

**Step 2:** Set the session start time when a user successfully logs in.

```javascript
const setSessionStartTime = () => {
  const currentTime = new Date().getTime();
  sessionStorage.setItem('sessionStartTime', currentTime.toString());
};
```

**Step 3:** Create a function to check if the session has timed out.

```javascript
const isSessionExpired = () => {
  const sessionStartTime = sessionStorage.getItem('sessionStartTime');
  if (!sessionStartTime) {
    return true; // Session start time is not set, so session has expired
  }

  const currentTime = new Date().getTime();
  return currentTime - parseInt(sessionStartTime) > SESSION_TIMEOUT;
};
```

**Step 4:** Call the session timeout check function periodically to automatically log out users.

```javascript
const checkSessionTimeout = () => {
  if (isSessionExpired()) {
    // Do any additional cleanup tasks if required
    sessionStorage.clear(); // Clear session data
    window.location.href = '/login'; // Redirect to login page
  }
};

// Periodically check session timeout every second
setInterval(checkSessionTimeout, 1000);
```

And that's it! By following these steps, you have implemented session timeout functionality using session storage in JavaScript.

Remember to customize the session timeout duration to suit your application's requirements. Additionally, you can enhance this solution by displaying a session timeout warning to the user before they are automatically logged out.

Make sure to test the implementation thoroughly to ensure it works as expected in different scenarios.
