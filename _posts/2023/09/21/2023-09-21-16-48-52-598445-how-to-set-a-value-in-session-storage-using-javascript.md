In this tutorial, we will learn how to set a value in `sessionStorage` using JavaScript. `sessionStorage` is a web storage object that allows storage of key/value pairs in the browser for the duration of the session.

To set a value in `sessionStorage`, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by accessing the `sessionStorage` object using `window.sessionStorage`. This object has methods to interact with the storage.

2. Use the `setItem()` method to set the key/value pair in the storage. Pass the desired key and value as arguments into this method.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to set a value in `sessionStorage`:

```javascript
// Set a value in sessionStorage
window.sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
```

In the above code, we are using the `setItem()` method to set the value `'value'` for the key `'key'`. 

Using `sessionStorage.setItem()` will store the value in the browser's sessionStorage. This value will persist until the session ends or until it is cleared.

**Note:** The `setItem()` method overwrites the existing value if the same key is used again.

That's it! You have now learned how to set a value in `sessionStorage` using JavaScript.

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we discussed how to set a value in `sessionStorage` using JavaScript. The `sessionStorage` object is a powerful tool for storing data in the browser's session. By utilizing the `setItem()` method, you can easily set and update key/value pairs in `sessionStorage`.
