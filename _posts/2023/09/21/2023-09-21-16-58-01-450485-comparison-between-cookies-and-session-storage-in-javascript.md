When working with web applications, it is common to store data locally on the client-side. Two popular methods for this are **cookies** and **session storage** in JavaScript. Both offer different ways to store and access data, but they have their own advantages and limitations. In this blog post, we will compare cookies and session storage to help you choose the right method for your application.

## Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data stored in a user's browser. They are sent to the server with every request, making them suitable for applications that require persistent data across multiple sessions. Here are some key points about cookies:

1. **Size Limitation**: Cookies have a maximum size limit of 4 KB, which means you need to be conscious of how much data you store in them.
2. **Expiration**: Cookies can be set with an expiration date, after which they will no longer be valid. This allows you to control the persistence of data.
3. **Storage Limitation**: Browsers typically have a limit on the number of cookies that can be stored, which is usually around 20 cookies per domain.

Example code for setting a cookie:
```javascript
document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2022 23:59:59 GMT; path=/";
```

## Session Storage

Session storage is a newer API introduced with HTML5. Unlike cookies, session storage is restricted to a single tab or window and is not sent to the server with each request. Here are some key points about session storage:

1. **Storage Limitation**: Session storage offers a larger storage capacity compared to cookies, with a limit of around 5 MB per domain.
2. **Session-based**: Data stored in session storage is available only for the duration of the session. Once the browser or tab is closed, the data is cleared.
3. **Simple API**: The session storage API is easy to use and provides methods to set, retrieve, and delete data.

Example code for setting session storage:
```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem("username", "John Doe");
```

# Conclusion

Cookies and session storage both serve the purpose of storing data on the client-side, but they have different use cases. Cookies are suitable for persistent data across multiple sessions and can be shared with the server, while session storage is ideal for temporary data that is limited to a single session. Consider your application requirements and choose the appropriate method accordingly.
