To define a generator function, you use the `function*` keyword followed by the function name. Inside the function, you can use the `yield` keyword to pause the execution and return a value. When the generator function is invoked, it doesn't actually run the code immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object, which can be used to control the execution.

Here's an example that demonstrates how generator functions work:

```javascript
function* generateNumbers() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const generator = generateNumbers();

console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

In this example, we define a generator function called `generateNumbers()`. Inside the function, we use the `yield` keyword to return values sequentially. When we invoke `generateNumbers()` and assign it to the `generator` variable, it returns a generator object. We can then use the `next()` method to resume the execution and get the next value in the sequence.

The `next()` method returns an object with two properties: `value` and `done`. The `value` property contains the value yielded by the generator, while the `done` property indicates whether the generator has finished iterating.

Generator functions provide a convenient way to create iterators in JavaScript. They allow you to control the flow of data using the `yield` keyword and can greatly simplify asynchronous programming tasks. So next time you need to create an iterator, give generator functions a try!
