When working with JavaScript, you have two primary ways of defining functions: function declarations and function expressions. While both approaches achieve the same outcome, there are subtle differences between them that can affect how you write and use your functions.

## Function Declarations

A function declaration is the most common and traditional way of defining a function in JavaScript. It involves using the `function` keyword followed by a name for your function and a set of parentheses to hold the function's parameter list. Here's an example of a function declaration:

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

One notable advantage of function declarations is that they are "hoisted" to the top of their containing scope. This means you can use the function before it is defined in the code, as the JavaScript interpreter moves all function declarations to the top during the compilation phase.

## Function Expressions

Function expressions, on the other hand, involve assigning a function to a variable. Instead of using the `function` keyword followed by a name, you start with the assignment operator (`=`) and create an anonymous function. Here's an example of a function expression:

```javascript
const addNumbers = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

One key difference between function expressions and function declarations is that function expressions are not hoisted. You must define the variable holding the function before using it in your code.

## Comparing Function Declarations and Function Expressions

Here's a comparison of some key factors to consider when choosing between function declarations and function expressions:

- **Hoisting**: Function declarations are hoisted, allowing you to use them before they are defined in the code. Function expressions require you to define the variable before using them.
- **Readability**: Function declarations provide a clear name for the function, making the code more readable. Function expressions can be more anonymous and harder to identify.
- **Flexibility**: Function expressions can be assigned to variables, making them useful for scenarios where you want to pass functions as arguments or assign them dynamically.

In general, function declarations are commonly used for standalone functions, while function expressions are useful for assigning functions to variables or passing them as arguments. The choice between the two ultimately depends on your specific use case and coding style preference.
