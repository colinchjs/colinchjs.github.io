In JavaScript, there are two common techniques for combining multiple operations: function composition and method chaining. While both approaches can achieve similar results, they have distinct differences in terms of syntax and usage. In this blog post, we will explore the concepts of function composition and method chaining, and discuss their pros and cons.

## Function Composition

Function composition involves combining multiple functions to create a new function. It allows us to build complex operations by chaining together smaller functions. In JavaScript, we can achieve function composition using the `compose` function from libraries like Ramda or lodash/fp.

Here's an example of function composition using Ramda:

```javascript
const { compose, add, multiply } = require('ramda');

const multiplyBy2AndAdd3 = compose(add(3), multiply(2));

console.log(multiplyBy2AndAdd3(5)); // Output: 13
```

In the above example, `compose` combines the `add` and `multiply` functions to create a new function `multiplyBy2AndAdd3`. This function takes a number, multiplies it by 2, and then adds 3 to the result.

Function composition provides a clear and declarative way to combine functions and enables reusability of smaller functions. However, it requires a library like Ramda or lodash/fp to easily compose functions.

## Method Chaining

Method chaining, on the other hand, involves invoking multiple methods on the same object in a single statement. It is a convenient way to execute a sequence of operations on an object without the need for creating intermediate variables. Method chaining is commonly used in JavaScript libraries like jQuery.

Here's an example of method chaining:

```javascript
class Calculator {
  constructor() {
    this.value = 0;
  }

  add(num) {
    this.value += num;
    return this;
  }

  multiply(num) {
    this.value *= num;
    return this;
  }

  getValue() {
    return this.value;
  }
}

const calc = new Calculator();

const result = calc.add(3).multiply(2).getValue();
console.log(result); // Output: 6
```

In the above example, the `Calculator` class implements the `add`, `multiply`, and `getValue` methods. By chaining these methods, we can perform addition and multiplication operations in a single statement.

Method chaining provides a concise and readable syntax for performing operations on objects. However, it may not be suitable for complex function compositions or reusable functions.

## Conclusion

Both function composition and method chaining offer ways to combine operations in JavaScript. Function composition allows for reusable functions and a declarative approach but requires a functional programming library. Method chaining provides a convenient syntax but may not be as flexible for complex operations.

Ultimately, the choice between function composition and method chaining depends on the specific use case and the desired coding style. Understanding the differences and advantages of each approach can help developers make informed decisions in their JavaScript code.
