When working with JavaScript functions, you may come across the terms "currying" and "partial application". These are two techniques that allow you to create new functions by manipulating existing functions. While they may seem similar, there are important differences between them. In this blog post, we will explore currying and partial application in JavaScript functions and understand how and when to use them.

## Currying

Currying is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a chain of single-argument functions. The curried function takes one argument at a time and returns a new function that expects the next argument. This process continues until all the arguments are supplied and the final result is returned.

Here's an example to illustrate currying:

```javascript
const multiply = (a, b, c) => a * b * c;
const curriedMultiply = (a) => (b) => (c) => multiply(a, b, c);

console.log(curriedMultiply(2)(3)(4));    // Output: 24
```

In this example, `curriedMultiply` is a curried version of `multiply` function. It takes one argument at a time and returns a new function until all the arguments are supplied.

Currying offers flexibility and allows for partial application, as we'll see next.

## Partial Application

Partial application is a technique where a function is partially applied with some of its arguments and returns a new function that expects the remaining arguments. It allows you to create new functions by fixing some arguments of an existing function.

Here's an example to demonstrate partial application:

```javascript
const multiply = (a, b, c) => a * b * c;
const partiallyAppliedMultiply = multiply.bind(null, 2, 3);

console.log(partiallyAppliedMultiply(4));    // Output: 24
```

In this example, `multiply` is partially applied with the arguments 2 and 3 using the `bind` method. The resulting function, `partiallyAppliedMultiply`, expects only the remaining argument (`c`) and returns the result.

Partial application is useful when you want to create specialized functions by fixing some arguments in advance and reusing them multiple times.

## Conclusion

Currying and partial application are both powerful techniques for creating new functions by manipulating existing ones. Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a series of single-argument functions, while partial application fixes some arguments of a function and returns a new function expecting the remaining arguments.

Knowing the difference between currying and partial application allows you to choose the right technique based on your specific use case. Whether you need the ability to supply arguments one at a time or fix certain arguments for reuse, these techniques can greatly enhance the flexibility and reusability of your JavaScript functions.
