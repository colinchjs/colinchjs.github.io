## Introduction

JavaScript is a flexible and dynamic programming language that allows developers to define and use functions in different ways. Two common approaches to defining functions in JavaScript are **function definitions** and **function expressions**. While both approaches serve the same purpose of defining reusable blocks of code, they have some important differences worth understanding.

## Function Definitions

Function definitions are the traditional way of defining functions in JavaScript. They use the `function` keyword followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses `()` to list the function parameters. The function body is enclosed in curly braces `{}`. 

Here's an example of a function definition:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

In this example, we define a function called `greet` that takes a single parameter `name` and logs a greeting message to the console.

Function definitions have a couple of important characteristics:

1. **Hoisting**: Function definitions are hoisted to the top of their scope, which means they can be called before they are defined in the code.

2. **Named functions**: Function definitions have a distinct name, allowing them to be referenced and called by their name throughout the code.

## Function Expressions

Function expressions, on the other hand, involve assigning a function to a variable or passing it as an argument to another function. They do not use the `function` keyword followed by the function name. Instead, they are defined directly as an anonymous function.

Here's an example of a function expression:

```javascript
const calculateArea = function(length, width) {
  return length * width;
};
```

In this example, we define a function expression and assign it to a variable called `calculateArea`. The function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns the area of a rectangle.

Function expressions have a couple of important characteristics:

1. **No hoisting**: Unlike function definitions, function expressions are not hoisted. They must be defined before they are called.

2. **Anonymous functions**: Function expressions do not have a distinct name, and they rely on the assigned variable to reference and call the function.

## Which approach to use?

The choice between function definitions and function expressions depends on the specific requirements and circumstances of your code.

- Use **function definitions** when you want the flexibility to call the function before it is defined, or when you need to refer to the function by its name.

- Use **function expressions** when you want to assign a function to a variable, pass it as an argument, or only need the function locally within a specific scope.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between function definitions and function expressions in JavaScript is essential for writing clean and efficient code. Both approaches have their advantages and use cases, so choose the one that best fits your specific requirements.
