When working with object-oriented programming in JavaScript, it's common to come across a scenario where you need to override a method inherited from a parent class in a child class. This is known as method overriding.

## What is Method Overriding?

Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows the subclass to modify the behavior of the inherited method without changing its signature.

## Implementing Method Overriding in JavaScript

In JavaScript, you can achieve method overriding through prototype-based inheritance. The prototype object is a shared object among all instances created using a constructor function. By modifying the prototype object of a child class, you can override a method inherited from the parent class.

Here is an example demonstrating method overriding in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Parent class
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Method in parent class
Animal.prototype.makeSound = function() {
  console.log(this.name + ' makes a sound');
};

// Child class
function Dog(name) {
  Animal.call(this, name);
}

// Inherit prototype from parent class
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

// Overridden method in child class
Dog.prototype.makeSound = function() {
  console.log(this.name + ' barks');
};

// Create instances
const animal = new Animal('Generic Animal');
const dog = new Dog('Fido');

// Call methods
animal.makeSound();  // Output: Generic Animal makes a sound
dog.makeSound();     // Output: Fido barks
```

In the example above, we have a parent class `Animal` with a method `makeSound`. The child class `Dog` inherits from the `Animal` class and overrides the `makeSound` method to make the dog "bark" instead of a generic sound.

## Conclusion

Method overriding in JavaScript allows you to modify the behavior of an inherited method in a child class. By using prototype-based inheritance, you can override methods and customize functionality according to your needs. Understanding and implementing method overriding is crucial when working with complex object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
