JavaScript functions are a powerful feature that allows for code reusability and abstraction. While most developers are familiar with **anonymous functions**, there is another type of function expression in JavaScript known as **named function expressions**.

## What are Named Function Expressions?

In a named function expression, we assign a name to the function at the time of its creation. This name can be used within the function itself and is also helpful for debugging purposes. The syntax for a named function expression is as follows:

```javascript
const funcName = function functionName() {
  // function body
};
```

## Advantages of Named Function Expressions

### Self Reference

One main advantage of named function expressions is that they can refer to themselves, which is especially useful for recursive functions. Here's an example:

```javascript
const factorial = function calculateFactorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
  }
};
```

In the above code, the function `calculateFactorial` refers to itself, allowing it to call itself recursively.

### Debugging

Named function expressions also make it easier to identify functions in stack traces and debugging tools. When an error occurs, having a named function expression provides a clear indication of where the error originates.

### Encapsulation

By using named function expressions, we can encapsulate variables and helper functions within a function scope. This helps avoid polluting the global scope and provides modularity to the codebase.

## Conclusion

Named function expressions are a useful feature in JavaScript for creating self-referencing functions and providing more meaningful stack traces during debugging. They help improve code readability and maintainability by encapsulating variables and functions within function scopes.
