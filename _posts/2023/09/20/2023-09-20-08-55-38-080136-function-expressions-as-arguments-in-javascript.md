In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and even returned from other functions. This feature allows for powerful and flexible programming paradigms.

One common use of this feature is passing function expressions as arguments to other functions. This allows us to create more dynamic and reusable code. Let's take a look at an example to understand how this works.

Suppose we have an array of numbers and we want to filter out the even numbers. We can use the `filter` method of arrays to do this. The `filter` method takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed for each element in the array. If the callback function returns `true`, the element is included in the filtered array, otherwise, it is excluded.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

In the example above, we passed a function expression as an argument to the `filter` method. This function expression takes a parameter `number` and checks if it is divisible by 2. If it is, it returns `true`, indicating that the number should be included in the filtered array.

By using function expressions as arguments, we can write concise and reusable code. We are not limited to simple arithmetic operations; we can also include more complex logic and conditions within the callback function.

Using function expressions as arguments opens up a whole new world of possibilities in JavaScript programming. By leveraging the power of higher-order functions like `filter`, `map`, and `reduce`, we can dramatically simplify our code and make it more efficient.
