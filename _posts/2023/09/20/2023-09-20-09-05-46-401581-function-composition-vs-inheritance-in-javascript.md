When it comes to structuring and organizing code in JavaScript, two common approaches are function composition and inheritance. Both approaches are used to achieve code reuse and improve code maintainability. In this blog post, we will dive deeper into each approach and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.

## Function Composition

Function composition is a design pattern in which smaller, more focused functions are combined together to accomplish a larger task. It emphasizes the concept of "building blocks" where each function performs a specific operation and passes its result to the next function. This allows for a more modular and flexible code structure.

### Advantages of Function Composition

1. **Code Reusability**: By separating functionality into smaller functions, you can easily reuse them in different parts of your codebase, leading to more efficient and maintainable code.

2. **Flexibility and Modularity**: Function composition allows you to easily combine different functions in various ways, creating new behavior without modifying existing functions. This promotes a more modular and flexible codebase that is easier to reason about.

3. **Testability**: Since each function has a specific responsibility, unit testing becomes simpler as you can test each function in isolation. This makes it easier to identify and fix any issues during the testing process.

### Example of Function Composition

Let's say we have three functions: `add`, `multiply`, and `subtract`. We can compose them together to create a new function `calculate` that performs the following operations: add two numbers, then multiply the result by a third number, and finally subtract a fourth number.

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

const calculate = (a, b, c, d) => subtract(multiply(add(a, b), c), d);
```

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where one class inherits the properties and methods of another class. By creating a "parent" class with common functionality, we can create "child" classes that inherit and extend this functionality. This approach allows for code reuse and promotes hierarchical relationships between classes.

### Advantages of Inheritance

1. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance allows us to create a hierarchy of classes, where child classes inherit and extend the functionality of their parent class. This promotes code reuse and reduces repetitive code.

2. **Polymorphism**: Inheritance enables polymorphism, meaning that objects of different classes can be treated as instances of a common parent class. This allows for more flexible and modular code.

3. **Encapsulation**: Inheritance promotes encapsulation by grouping related functionality together in a single class. This improves code organization and makes it easier to understand and maintain.

### Example of Inheritance

Here's an example using JavaScript's built-in inheritance mechanism through the `class` keyword:

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name, sound) {
    this.name = name;
    this.sound = sound;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes ${this.sound}`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name, 'woof');
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog('Buddy');
myDog.speak(); // Output: Buddy makes woof
```

## Which Approach to Choose?

The choice between function composition and inheritance depends on the specific requirements of your project. Function composition is generally recommended for simpler and more decoupled codebases, while inheritance may be more suitable for complex systems with hierarchical relationships.

Remember that these approaches are not mutually exclusive and can be used together to accomplish different goals within the same project.
