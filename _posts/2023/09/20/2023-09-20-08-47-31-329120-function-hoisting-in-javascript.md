One of the interesting features of JavaScript is called function hoisting. **Function hoisting** allows you to use a function declaration before it is defined in your code. This behavior might seem unusual at first, but it can be quite useful in certain scenarios.

## How Function Hoisting Works

In JavaScript, when you define a function using the `function` keyword, the entire function declaration is hoisted to the top of its enclosing scope. This means that you can call the function even before it is defined in your code.

```javascript
sayHello(); // Calling the function before declaration

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

In the above example, the `sayHello` function is called before it is defined. Normally, without function hoisting, this would throw an error. However, due to function hoisting, the function can be called without any issues.

## Best Practices

While function hoisting can be convenient, it is generally considered a good practice to define your functions before using them in your code. This makes your code more readable and easier to understand for other developers.

It is important to note that only function declarations are hoisted in JavaScript, not function expressions. So, when using function expressions, ensure that the function is defined before calling it.

## Conclusion

Function hoisting in JavaScript allows you to use function declarations before they are defined in your code. It provides flexibility, but it's important to remember to define your functions before using them for better code readability. Understanding how function hoisting works will help you write better organized and maintainable JavaScript code.
