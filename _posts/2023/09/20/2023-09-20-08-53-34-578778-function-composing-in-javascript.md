JavaScript provides powerful features for working with functions, including the ability to compose functions. Function composition allows you to combine multiple functions into a single function, making your code more modular, reusable, and easier to reason about.

## What is function composition?

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. It involves chaining the output of one function to the input of another, creating a pipeline of transformations. Function composition allows you to break down complex operations into smaller, more manageable functions.

## How to compose functions in JavaScript

In JavaScript, we can compose functions using various techniques, such as using higher-order functions, the `compose` function, or libraries like Ramda or Lodash. Let's explore a few examples.

### Using higher-order functions

One way to compose functions is by using higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments and/or return a function. Here's an example of composing functions using higher-order functions:

```javascript
const multiplyBy2 = (num) => num * 2;
const add5 = (num) => num + 5;

const compose = (f, g) => (x) => f(g(x));

const multiplyBy2AndAdd5 = compose(add5, multiplyBy2);

console.log(multiplyBy2AndAdd5(3)); // Output: 11
```

In the above example, we have two functions, `multiplyBy2` and `add5`, which we want to compose. We define a `compose` function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function. This new function takes an input value `x`, applies `g(x)` (which is `multiplyBy2` in this case), and then applies `f(result)` (which is `add5` in this case).

By calling `multiplyBy2AndAdd5(3)`, we get the expected output of `11`.

### Using the `compose` function

JavaScript also provides a built-in `compose` function in the `lodash/fp` package (functional programming version of lodash library) or the `ramda` library. Here's an example using the `compose` function from `lodash/fp`:

```javascript
const _ = require('lodash/fp');

const multiplyBy2 = (num) => num * 2;
const add5 = (num) => num + 5;

const multiplyBy2AndAdd5 = _.compose(add5, multiplyBy2);

console.log(multiplyBy2AndAdd5(3)); // Output: 11
```

In this example, we use the `compose` function from `lodash/fp` to compose the `add5` and `multiplyBy2` functions. The resulting `multiplyBy2AndAdd5` function can then be called with an input value, producing the expected output of `11`.

## Benefits of function composition

Function composition brings several benefits to our code structures:

- **Modularity**: Composing functions allows us to break down complex operations into smaller, more manageable units of logic.
- **Reusability**: Composed functions can be reused in different parts of our codebase, increasing code reusability and reducing duplication.
- **Readability**: By breaking down operations into smaller functions, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand.
- **Maintainability**: Composed functions are easier to maintain as changes to one function have minimal impact on others in the composition chain.

## Conclusion

Function composition is a powerful technique that allows us to build more modular, reusable, and maintainable JavaScript code. By composing functions, we can create a pipeline of transformations that make our code more readable and understandable.

Whether by using higher-order functions, the `compose` function from libraries like lodash or Ramda, or other techniques, embracing function composition can enhance the architecture and design of our JavaScript applications.
