In JavaScript, functions can return values after performing a specific task or computation. The return statement is used to specify the value to be returned from a function. This allows us to use the result of a function in other parts of our code.

To define a function with a return value in JavaScript, we can use the `function` keyword, followed by the name of the function, parentheses for any arguments, and curly braces to enclose the body of the function. Within the function body, we use the `return` keyword followed by the value we want to return.

Here is an example of a function that calculates the sum of two numbers and returns the result:

```javascript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

var result = calculateSum(5, 3);
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

In the above code, the `calculateSum` function takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum using the `return` statement. We can then call the function and assign its return value to a variable `result`, which can be used later in our code.

It's important to note that a function can only return one value. However, this value can be of any data type - a number, string, object, or even another function.

We can also use conditional statements within a function to conditionally return different values based on certain conditions. Here is an example:

```javascript
function isEven(num) {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

console.log(isEven(4)); // Output: true
console.log(isEven(7)); // Output: false
```

In the `isEven` function, we check if the given number `num` is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the condition is true, we return `true`, indicating that the number is even. Otherwise, we return `false`.

When using a return value from a function, we can store it in a variable, pass it as an argument to another function, or use it in any other way as required by our program.

By leveraging the power of function return values, we can make our code more modular, reusable, and easier to understand.
