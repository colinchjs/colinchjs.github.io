In JavaScript, there are two ways to define functions: **anonymous functions** and **named functions**. Both have their own benefits and uses. In this article, we will explore the differences between these two types of functions and when to use each one.

## Anonymous Functions

An anonymous function is a function without a name. It is defined using the `function` keyword followed by a set of parentheses `()` and a block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Here's an example of an anonymous function:

```javascript
const sum = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};
```

Anonymous functions are often used in JavaScript for several reasons:

1. **Function expressions**: Anonymous functions are commonly used as function expressions, which can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions.

2. **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**: Anonymous functions can be invoked immediately after they are defined. This allows you to create a function and execute it immediately without having to store it in a variable.

3. **Closures**: Anonymous functions are often used within closures to encapsulate variables and create private scopes.

## Named Functions

On the other hand, a named function is a function that has a name. It is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, a set of parentheses `()`, and a block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Here's an example of a named function:

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}
```

Named functions in JavaScript offer the following advantages:

1. **Code readability**: Giving a function a meaningful name improves code readability and makes it easier to understand the purpose of the function.

2. **Reusability**: Named functions can be reused multiple times throughout your codebase. By defining a function with a specific name, you can call it anywhere in your code without duplicating the function's implementation.

3. **Better stack traces**: Named functions provide more helpful stack traces when debugging code because the function's name is included in the error message.

## When to Use Each

Now that we understand the differences between anonymous and named functions, let's discuss when to use each one.

Use **anonymous functions** when:

- You need a function expression that can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument.
- You want to create an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).
- You need to create a closure to encapsulate variables.

Use **named functions** when:

- You want to improve code readability by giving a function a meaningful name.
- You need to reuse a function in multiple places within your codebase.
- You want better stack traces for debugging purposes.

## Conclusion

In JavaScript, both anonymous and named functions have their uses. Anonymous functions are great for function expressions, IIFEs, and closures, while named functions are ideal for code readability, reusability, and better stack traces. Understanding the differences between the two types will help you choose the appropriate function type based on your specific requirements.
