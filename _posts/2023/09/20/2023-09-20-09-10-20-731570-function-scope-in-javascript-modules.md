When working with JavaScript modules, understanding function scope is crucial for maintaining clean and organized code. In this article, we will explore function scope within JavaScript modules and how it can help encapsulate code and prevent variable conflicts.

## What is Function Scope?

Function scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions within a particular function. In JavaScript, each function creates its own scope, meaning that variables declared within a function are not accessible outside of that function.

## JavaScript Modules and Function Scope

JavaScript modules provide a way to encapsulate code by utilizing function scope. By defining functions within a module, we can ensure that the variables declared within those functions are accessible only within the module itself. This prevents any variable conflicts that might arise when different modules are combined or used together.

## Example

Let's consider an example where we have two modules: `moduleA.js` and `moduleB.js`. 

In `moduleA.js`, we define a function `sum` that calculates the sum of two numbers:

```javascript
// moduleA.js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

In `moduleB.js`, we define another function `multiply` that calculates the product of two numbers:

```javascript
// moduleB.js
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

Both modules have their own function scope, meaning that the variables `a` and `b` within each module are independent of each other. This prevents any conflicts if the same variable names are used in different modules.

## Conclusion

Function scope is an essential concept when working with JavaScript modules. It allows us to encapsulate code within functions, preventing variable conflicts and maintaining a clean and organized codebase. By understanding function scope, we can effectively manage modules and ensure the proper separation of concerns in our JavaScript projects.
