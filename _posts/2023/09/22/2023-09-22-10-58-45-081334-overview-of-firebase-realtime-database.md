Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and synchronize data in real-time. 

## Features of Firebase Realtime Database

- **Real-time synchronization**: The Firebase Realtime Database enables developers to provide real-time updates to users. Any changes made to the database are instantly synced across all connected devices.

- **No setup required**: Firebase Realtime Database is a fully-managed service, meaning you don't have to worry about server maintenance or scaling. It automatically handles data replication and all the necessary infrastructure.

- **Offline support**: Firebase Realtime Database allows your app to continue functioning even when there is no internet connection. The database persists data locally on the device, and as soon as the connection is restored, it syncs the changes with the server.

- **Secure and scalable**: Firebase Realtime Database includes built-in security rules that allow you to control access to your data. You can define rules to allow read or write access based on user authentication or other conditions. It also scales seamlessly to handle any number of users and concurrent connections.
