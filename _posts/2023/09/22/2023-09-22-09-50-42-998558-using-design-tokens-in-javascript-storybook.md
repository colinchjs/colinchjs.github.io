Design tokens are a powerful tool for maintaining a consistent design system across different platforms and applications. They are key-value pairs that represent visual attributes such as colors, typography, spacing, and more. In this blog post, we will explore how to use design tokens in JavaScript Storybook to create a living style guide for your application.

## What is Storybook?

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open-source development tool for building UI components. It enables developers to create isolated and interactive components in a sandboxed environment. Storybook allows you to develop and showcase your UI components independently of your main application, making it easier to iterate and test different variations.

## Setting Up Design Tokens in Storybook

To start using design tokens in Storybook, there are a few steps you need to follow:

1. **Create a Design Tokens file**: Design tokens can be stored in a dedicated file or as a JavaScript object. To keep things organized, it's recommended to create a separate file for your design tokens, such as `tokens.js`.

2. **Define your Design Tokens**: In the design tokens file, define your tokens as constants or variables, assigning them the desired values. For example:

```javascript
// tokens.js
export const colors = {
  primary: '#FF0000',
  secondary: '#00FF00',
};

export const fontSizes = {
  small: 12,
  medium: 16,
};
```

3. **Import Design Tokens**: In your component files, import the design tokens you have defined. For example:

```javascript
import { colors, fontSizes } from './tokens';
```

## Using Design Tokens in Storybook

Once you have set up your design tokens, you can start using them in Storybook to create consistent UI components.

**Example 1: Using Design Tokens for Colors**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { colors } from './tokens';

const Button = () => (
  <button style={{ backgroundColor: colors.primary, color: colors.secondary }}>
    Click Me
  </button>
);

export default Button;
```

In the above example, we use the colors design tokens to define the background color and text color of a button component. This ensures consistency and allows easy modification of colors throughout the application.

**Example 2: Using Design Tokens for Typography**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { fontSizes } from './tokens';

const Heading = ({ level, children }) => {
  const Tag = `h${level}`;

  return <Tag style={{ fontSize: fontSizes.medium }}>{children}</Tag>;
};

export default Heading;
```

In this example, we use the `fontSizes` design token to set the font size of the heading component dynamically based on the `level` prop passed to it.

Using design tokens in Storybook provides a centralized approach to managing and using your design system across different components. It allows you to make design changes in one place and reflects those changes automatically throughout your application.

## Conclusion

Design tokens are a valuable tool for maintaining consistency and scalability in your design system. By integrating design tokens into your JavaScript Storybook workflow, you can establish a living style guide that streamlines the development process and promotes design best practices.
