Design tools like Sketch and Figma play a crucial role in the user interface (UI) design process. They allow designers to create and refine UI components before they are implemented in code. One challenge developers face is keeping the codebase in sync with the design changes. This is where JavaScript Storybook comes in.

JavaScript Storybook is a powerful tool for developing UI components in isolation. It provides a development environment where you can view and interact with your components in different states and variations. With Storybook, you can also integrate your design tools to ensure that your components look and behave exactly like the designs.

In this article, we will explore how to integrate design tools like Sketch and Figma with JavaScript Storybook.

## Storybook with Sketch
Storybook offers a Sketch addon that allows you to import Sketch files directly into your UI components. To get started, you need to install the `@storybook/addon-sketch` package:

```shell
npm install @storybook/addon-sketch --save-dev
```

Once the package is installed, you can import the Sketch file in your story file using the `withSketch` function:

```javascript
import { withSketch } from '@storybook/addon-sketch';

export default {
  title: 'Button',
  decorators: [withSketch({ viewports: [320, 768] })],
};

export const Primary = () => <Button>Primary Button</Button>;
```

With the above configuration, you will see a new tab in the Storybook UI interface named "Sketch". This tab will display the imported Sketch file along with your UI component, allowing you to compare and ensure design accuracy.

## Storybook with Figma
Similar to Sketch, Storybook also provides an addon for integrating Figma. To start, install the `@storybook/addon-figma` package:

```shell
npm install @storybook/addon-figma --save-dev
```

Once installed, you can import your Figma designs in your story file using the `withFigma` function:

```javascript
import { withFigma } from '@storybook/addon-figma';

export default {
  title: 'Button',
  decorators: [
    withFigma({
      url: 'https://www.figma.com/file/your-figma-file-url',
    }),
  ],
};

export const Primary = () => <Button>Primary Button</Button>;
```

By adding the above configuration, a new "Figma" tab will appear in the Storybook UI. This tab will show a live preview of your Figma design alongside your UI component.

## Conclusion
Integrating design tools like Sketch and Figma with JavaScript Storybook provides developers with an efficient way to ensure that their UI components look and behave as intended. Using the Sketch and Figma addons, you can easily import your designs into Storybook and compare them side by side with your components, simplifying the design-to-code workflow.
