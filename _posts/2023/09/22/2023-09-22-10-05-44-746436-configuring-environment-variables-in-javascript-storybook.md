Environment variables are an essential part of modern software development, allowing us to configure our applications based on different deployment environments. Storybook, a tool for developing UI components in isolation, also provides a way to configure environment variables.

In this blog post, we will explore how to configure environment variables in a JavaScript Storybook project.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js
- NPM

## Step 1: Create a `.env` File
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your Storybook project. This file will hold the environment variables.

```javascript
API_URL=https://api.example.com
API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Replace `https://api.example.com` with your actual API endpoint and `your-api-key` with the corresponding API key.

## Step 2: Install `dotenv` Package
Next, we need to install the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from the `.env` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npm install dotenv
```

## Step 3: Configure Storybook Webpack
Create a file named `webpack.config.js` in the `.storybook` directory. This file will contain the webpack configuration for Storybook.

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack');
const dotenv = require('dotenv');

module.exports = ({ config }) => {
  // Load environment variables from .env file
  const env = dotenv.config().parsed;
  
  // Define environment variables
  const envKeys = Object.keys(env).reduce((acc, curr) => {
    acc[`process.env.${curr}`] = JSON.stringify(env[curr]);
    return acc;
  }, {});

  // Add environment variables to webpack config
  config.plugins.push(new webpack.DefinePlugin(envKeys));

  return config;
};
```

## Step 4: Update Storybook Configuration

Open the `.storybook/main.js` file and add the following lines at the top:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
```

## Step 5: Access Environment Variables
Now, you can access the environment variables in your Storybook stories or any JavaScript file within your project:

```javascript
console.log(process.env.API_URL); // Output: https://api.example.com
console.log(process.env.API_KEY); // Output: your-api-key
```

Congratulations! You have successfully configured environment variables in your JavaScript Storybook project.

## Conclusion
Configuring environment variables in JavaScript Storybook allows you to manage different API endpoints, authentication keys, and other configuration parameters for development, staging, and production environments. By using this setup, you can easily switch between environments without modifying your codebase.
