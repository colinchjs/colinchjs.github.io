Storybook is a powerful tool for developing and testing UI components in JavaScript. It allows you to create a living style guide that provides a collaborative environment for designers and developers. In this blog post, we will discuss how to write component examples in JavaScript Storybook.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have Storybook installed. Use the following command to install Storybook globally on your machine:

```shell
npm install -g @storybook/cli
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to initialize Storybook:

```shell
npx -p @storybook/cli sb init
```

This will create a `.storybook` directory in your project, along with some initial configuration files.

## Writing Component Examples

To write component examples in Storybook, create a `.stories.js` file for each component you want to showcase.

```javascript
// Button.stories.js

import React from 'react';
import { Button } from './Button';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
};

export const Primary = () => <Button variant="primary">Primary Button</Button>;

export const Secondary = () => <Button variant="secondary">Secondary Button</Button>;
```

In the example above, we import the `Button` component and define a story for it. The `title` property is used to organize the component within Storybook's sidebar. The `component` property specifies the component itself.

Next, we define different stories using the `export` syntax. Each story is a stand-alone component that showcases the different variations or use cases of the component. In this case, we have `Primary` and `Secondary` button examples.

You can also pass props to your component stories. For example:

```javascript
export const Danger = () => <Button variant="danger">Danger Button</Button>;
```

## Previewing Component Examples

To preview your component examples, run the following command inside your project directory:

```shell
npm run storybook
```

This will start the Storybook server, and you can then access it by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:6006`.

You will see a list of all your registered component examples, and you can interact with them to view and test their behavior.

## Conclusion

Writing component examples in JavaScript Storybook is a great way to visually showcase and test your UI components. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you will be able to create a living style guide that helps improve collaboration and maintain consistency in your UI development process.
