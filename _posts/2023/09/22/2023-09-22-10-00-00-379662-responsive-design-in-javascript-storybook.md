With the increasing popularity of mobile devices and different screen sizes, it is crucial to ensure that your web application or website is responsive and compatible across various devices. One powerful tool to achieve this is **Javascript Storybook**. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement responsive design using Javascript Storybook.

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is an open-source tool that allows you to develop and test UI components in isolation. It provides a sandbox environment where you can create and view your components individually, allowing for rapid development and testing. Storybook supports multiple frameworks, including React, Vue, and Angular.

## Implementing Responsive Design in Storybook

To implement responsive design in Storybook, we can leverage the power of CSS media queries. Media queries allow you to apply different CSS styles based on the device's screen size or other criteria. Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started:

1. Install Storybook: If you haven't already, install Storybook in your project by following the official documentation for your chosen framework.

2. Create a Responsive Component: In your Storybook project, create a new component or select an existing one that you want to make responsive. For example, let's assume we have a component called `Button` that we want to make responsive.

3. Define CSS Media Queries: Inside the `Button` component file, define CSS media queries using either inline styles or a separate CSS file. For example, you can define different styles for different screen sizes using the `@media` rule:

   ```css
   /* Styles for small screens */
   @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
     .button {
       /* Your styles for small screens */
     }
   }

   /* Styles for medium screens */
   @media screen and (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
     .button {
       /* Your styles for medium screens */
     }
   }

   /* Styles for large screens */
   @media screen and (min-width: 1201px) {
     .button {
       /* Your styles for large screens */
     }
   }
   ```

  Replace the placeholders with the actual styles you want to apply.

4. Create Responsive Stories: In your Storybook project, create a new story for your responsive component. Inside the story file, import the `Button` component and define different stories for different screen sizes using the `addParameters` function. For example:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';

   import Button from './Button';

   storiesOf('Components/Button', module)
     .addParameters({
       viewport: {
         defaultViewport: 'large',
         viewports: {
           small: {
             name: 'Small',
             styles: {
               width: '600px',
               height: '800px',
             },
           },
           medium: {
             name: 'Medium',
             styles: {
               width: '900px',
               height: '800px',
             },
           },
           large: {
             name: 'Large',
             styles: {
               width: '1200px',
               height: '800px',
             },
           },
         },
       },
     })
     .add('Default', () => <Button />);
   ```

   Replace the `addParameters` section with the appropriate screen sizes and dimensions for your application.

5. Test and Preview: Start your Storybook server and open the stories in different viewports to test the responsiveness of your component. You can easily switch between different screen sizes using the viewport selection tool.

By following these steps, you can create responsive designs using Javascript Storybook, allowing you to easily visualize and test your components across various screen sizes.
