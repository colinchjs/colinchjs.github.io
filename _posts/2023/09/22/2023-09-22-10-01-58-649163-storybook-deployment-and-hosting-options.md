Storybook is a powerful tool for developing and documenting UI components in isolation. Once you've built your component library using Storybook, you'll need to deploy and host it so that other developers can access and use your components. In this blog post, we'll explore some popular deployment and hosting options for Storybook.

## 1. GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free and simple option for hosting your Storybook. By leveraging GitHub Actions, you can automatically deploy your Storybook to a GitHub Pages repository whenever changes are pushed to your repository. This makes it easy to share your components with others and provide a live preview of your UI library.

To set up GitHub Pages for your Storybook, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub or use an existing one.
2. Install the `storybook-deployer` package: `npm install --save-dev storybook-deployer`.
3. Configure your `storybook-deployer` in your `package.json` file.
4. Create a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file to trigger deployment on each push.
5. Commit and push your changes to trigger the deployment workflow.

After these steps, your Storybook will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever you push changes to your repository.

## 2. Netlify

Netlify is a popular hosting platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage static websites, including Storybook. With its simple setup and automatic deploys, Netlify provides a seamless experience for hosting your Storybook and integrating it with your development workflow.

To deploy your Storybook to Netlify, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a Netlify account if you haven't already.
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
3. Configure the build settings for your Storybook project.
4. Trigger a build or set up continuous deployment to automatically deploy changes.

Once deployed, Netlify will provide you with a unique URL for your Storybook, allowing you to share and showcase your UI components.

## Conclusion

Hosting and deploying your Storybook is crucial to share and collaborate on your UI component library. Whether you choose GitHub Pages or Netlify, both options provide seamless integration with your development workflow and make it easy to showcase your components. Consider your specific needs and preferences to choose the best option for your project.
