In modern web development, CSS frameworks have become an essential part of building user interfaces quickly and efficiently. They provide pre-designed CSS styles and components that can be easily integrated into your projects. One of the challenges developers face is ensuring that these CSS frameworks work seamlessly with their Javascript tooling. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate CSS frameworks with **Javascript Storybook**, a popular tool for developing UI components in isolation.

## What is Javascript Storybook?

Javascript Storybook is a UI development environment that allows you to build, test, and document UI components. It provides an isolated environment where you can develop and showcase your components independently of your main application. Storybook supports multiple frameworks, such as React, Vue, and Angular, making it a versatile tool for frontend development.

## Why integrate CSS frameworks with Storybook?

When working with CSS frameworks, we want to ensure that our components look and feel consistent across different screens and devices. By integrating CSS frameworks with Storybook, we can develop and test our components in a controlled environment, making it easier to identify any styling issues or conflicts with the framework.

## Steps to integrate CSS frameworks with Storybook

1. Install the required dependencies:
```
npm install @storybook/react
```
2. Create a `.storybook` directory in the root of your project if it doesn't exist already.
3. Inside the `.storybook` directory, create a `config.js` file with the following content:
```javascript
import { configure } from '@storybook/react';

configure(require.context('../src/stories', true, /\.stories\.js$/), module);
```
4. Create a `webpack.config.js` file in the `.storybook` directory with the following content:
```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
        include: path.resolve(__dirname, '../'),
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
5. Install the CSS framework you want to integrate (e.g., Bootstrap, Bulma, Tailwind CSS) using a package manager like npm or yarn.

6. Import the CSS file for your chosen framework into your `config.js` file:
```javascript
import 'path/to/css/framework.css';
```

7. Start Storybook with the following command:
```
npm run storybook
```

Now you can start developing and testing your components with the integrated CSS framework in Storybook. Any styles provided by the framework should be applied to your components automatically.

## Conclusion

Integrating CSS frameworks with Javascript Storybook allows developers to develop and test UI components in an isolated environment while leveraging the power and convenience of CSS frameworks. This integration ensures consistency in styling and helps identify any conflicts or issues early on in the development process. By following the steps mentioned above, you can easily integrate your favorite CSS frameworks with Storybook and streamline your UI component development workflow.
