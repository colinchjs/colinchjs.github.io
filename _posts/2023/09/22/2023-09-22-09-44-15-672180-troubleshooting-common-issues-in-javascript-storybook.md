If you are working with JavaScript Storybook, you might encounter various issues during development. These issues can sometimes be frustrating, but fear not! This blog post will guide you through troubleshooting some common issues and finding solutions.

## 1. Storybook not starting or running

If Storybook fails to start or run, there are a few potential causes:

### Solution 1 - Verify dependencies

First, make sure that you have all the required dependencies installed correctly. Check your `package.json` file and ensure that you have the necessary packages, such as `@storybook/react` or `@storybook/vue`, installed in the correct versions. Additionally, verify that you have installed the required peer dependencies as well.

### Solution 2 - Check configuration files

Next, double-check your Storybook configuration files. Ensure that the `main.js`, `.storybook/main.js`, or `.storybook/config.js` file is set up properly and contains the correct configuration options. Make sure that the story files are located in the correct directories and follow the expected naming conventions.

### Solution 3 - Clear cache and restart

Sometimes, clearing the Storybook cache and restarting the development server can resolve issues. Try running the following command in your project directory:

```shell
npx sb clean-cache
```

After cleaning the cache, restart Storybook to see if the issue persists.

## 2. Stories not showing up in Storybook

If your stories are not visible in Storybook, here are a few things to check:

### Solution 1 - Verify story file structure

Ensure that your story files follow the correct naming and import conventions. By default, Storybook looks for files with names ending in `.stories.js`, `.stories.jsx`, `.stories.ts`, or `.stories.tsx` in the same directory as your component files. Make sure your stories are properly located and named.

### Solution 2 - Check storybook configuration

Review your Storybook configuration files (e.g., `main.js`, `.storybook/main.js`, `.storybook/config.js`) and ensure that the `configure` function is correctly set up. Ensure that the appropriate add-ons and decorators are configured to display your stories.

### Solution 3 - Import issues

Double-check your imports in the story files. Incorrect or missing imports can prevent your stories from displaying correctly. Verify that you have imported the components or modules needed to showcase your stories.

## Conclusion

Troubleshooting issues in JavaScript Storybook can be challenging, especially if you are new to the framework. By following the solutions outlined above, you can address some common issues and get back to building your beautiful UI component library in no time!
