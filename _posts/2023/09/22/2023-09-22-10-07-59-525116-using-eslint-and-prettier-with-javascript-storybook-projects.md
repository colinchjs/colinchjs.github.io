When working on JavaScript Storybook projects, it's essential to maintain consistent code style and ensure that there are no syntax errors in the code. Two popular tools that can help with this are ESLint and Prettier. In this article, we will explore how to set up and use ESLint and Prettier in your JavaScript Storybook projects.

## What is ESLint?

ESLint is a popular pluggable linting utility for JavaScript. It helps identify and report patterns or code that might be problematic. With ESLint, you can enforce consistent coding styles, catch common errors, and improve code quality.

## What is Prettier?

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that focuses on code style consistency. It enforces a set of rules and automatically formats your code to match those rules. Prettier can be used with various programming languages, including JavaScript.

## Setting Up ESLint and Prettier

To use ESLint and Prettier in your JavaScript Storybook projects, follow these steps:

1. Install ESLint and Prettier as dev dependencies:
```javascript
npm install eslint prettier --save-dev
```

2. Install the ESLint plugin for Prettier:
```javascript
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-prettier
```
This command will install the necessary ESLint configuration to make it work with Prettier.

3. Create an `.eslintrc.json` file in the project root directory with the following configuration:
```json
{
  "extends": ["plugin:prettier/recommended"]
}
```
This configuration extends the Prettier rules and ensures that ESLint integrates well with Prettier.

4. Create a `.prettierrc.json` file in the project root directory with your preferred Prettier configuration. For example:
```json
{
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```
This configuration file specifies the desired code formatting rules.

## Integrating with Storybook

To integrate ESLint and Prettier with Storybook, you can set up linting and formatting as part of your project's build or test scripts. For example, you can add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

ESLint and Prettier are powerful tools for improving code quality and maintaining consistent code style in JavaScript Storybook projects. By setting them up correctly and integrating them into your development workflow, you can catch and prevent common errors and ensure a clean and professional codebase.
