When building a React component library, it's important to have clear and comprehensive documentation for each component. One popular tool for documenting React components is [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Storybook allows you to develop and document your components in isolation, making it easier for other developers to understand and use them.

One crucial part of component documentation is documenting the props that a component accepts. By documenting props, developers can easily see what data need to be passed down to a component and understand their expected types and default values.

## Documenting Props with Storybook

To document component props in Storybook, we can make use of the `@storybook/addon-docs` package. This package allows us to write stories with documentation in Markdown and automatically extracts information about the component's props.

To get started, make sure you have Storybook set up in your project. If not, you can follow the [official documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install) to install and configure it.

Once Storybook is set up, we can start documenting our component props:

1. Install the `@storybook/addon-docs` package:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @storybook/addon-docs
```

2. In your `.storybook/main.js` configuration file, add the `@storybook/addon-docs` package to the `addons` array:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...other config options
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-docs'],
};
```

3. In your component stories file, import the `withDocs` function from `@storybook/addon-docs`:

```jsx
import { withDocs } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
```

4. Wrap your component's story with the `withDocs` function, passing the Markdown documentation as the second argument:

```jsx
export default {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  decorators: [withDocs(ButtonDocs)],
};

export const Default = () => <Button>Click Me</Button>;

const ButtonDocs = `
## Button Component

The Button component renders a clickable button element.

### Props

- \`onClick\` (function): Callback function to be executed when the button is clicked.

#### Example Usage

\`\`\`jsx
<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</Button>
\`\`\`
`;
```

In the example above, we import `withDocs` and wrap our `Button` component story with it. We provide the Markdown documentation as a string, including information about the props, their types, and example usage.

By following these steps, your component's props will be automatically documented within the Storybook interface, allowing other developers to easily understand how to use your components.

## Conclusion

Documenting component props is crucial for enhancing the usability and maintainability of your React component library. Storybook's `@storybook/addon-docs` package makes it easy to document and showcase your component's props, helping other developers effectively use your components. With clear and comprehensive documentation, developers can quickly understand how to use your components and reduce the likelihood of errors.
