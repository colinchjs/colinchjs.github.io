Design tokens are a set of values that define the visual properties of an interface. They act as the building blocks for consistent and scalable design systems. With the rise of component-driven development, it is essential to integrate design tokens seamlessly with popular styling libraries like `styled-components`.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use design tokens with `styled-components` in JavaScript Storybook, a popular tool for developing UI components in isolation. This will allow us to create reusable and consistent styles across different components while also providing a centralized place to manage and update our design tokens.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of `styled-components`
- Familiarity with JavaScript and CSS

## Step 1: Setting Up Storybook
Before we start integrating design tokens, let's set up JavaScript Storybook in our project (if not already configured). Follow the Storybook documentation to get started.

## Step 2: Creating the Design Tokens
Design tokens typically consist of key-value pairs defining various properties like colors, typography, spacing, etc. Create a new file, `tokens.js`, to hold our design tokens:

```javascript
// tokens.js

export const colors = {
  primary: '#007bff',
  secondary: '#6c757d',
  // ...
};

export const typography = {
  fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif',
  fontSize: {
    small: '12px',
    medium: '16px',
    large: '20px',
  },
  // ...
};

export const spacing = {
  small: '8px',
  medium: '16px',
  large: '24px',
  // ...
};
```

Feel free to add more tokens based on your project's requirements.

## Step 3: Creating the Styled Components
Now, let's create a styled component using the design tokens we defined. In a new file, `Button.js`, add the following code:

```javascript
// Button.js
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { colors, typography, spacing } from './tokens';

const Button = styled.button`
  color: ${colors.primary};
  font-family: ${typography.fontFamily};
  font-size: ${typography.fontSize.medium};
  padding: ${spacing.small} ${spacing.medium};
  border-radius: 4px;
  border: none;
  // ...
`;

export default Button;
```

Here, we are using the `colors`, `typography`, and `spacing` tokens to style our button component. By referencing the design tokens, we create a consistent look and feel across our UI.

## Step 4: Using the Styled Component in Storybook
Now that we have our `Button` component, let's use it in a Storybook story to see the results. In a new file, `Button.stories.js`, add the following code:

```javascript
// Button.stories.js
import React from 'react';
import Button from './Button';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
};

export const Primary = () => <Button>Primary Button</Button>;
export const Secondary = () => <Button secondary>Secondary Button</Button>;
```

Here, we import our `Button` component and define two stories - one for the primary button and another for the secondary button. By passing properties to the `Button` component, we can further customize its appearance.

## Step 5: Viewing the Styled Component in Storybook
Start Storybook by running the appropriate command in your terminal. Once Storybook is up and running, navigate to the `Button` section to see the rendered components.

You should notice that the `Button` component is styled using the design tokens we defined earlier. By modifying the design tokens, we can easily update the styles of multiple components throughout our application.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to integrate design tokens with `styled-components` in JavaScript Storybook. This allows us to create reusable and consistent styles across different components while maintaining a centralized place to manage and update our design tokens. By leveraging design tokens, we can easily create scalable and consistent design systems for our UI components.
