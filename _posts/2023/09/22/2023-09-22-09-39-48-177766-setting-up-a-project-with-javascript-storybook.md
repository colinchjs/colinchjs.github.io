In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up a project with Storybook for developing and testing Javascript components in isolation. Storybook is a popular tool that allows you to build and document UI components in a systematic and organized way.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can check the versions by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

## Step 1: Initialize the project

Start by creating a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Next, initialize a new Node.js project using the following command:

```
npm init -y
```

This command will create a `package.json` file with default values.

## Step 2: Install Storybook

To install Storybook, run the following command:

```
npx sb init
```

This command will guide you through the installation process and configure Storybook for your project. It will set up a `src` directory for your components and a `.storybook` directory for Storybook configuration files.

## Step 3: Add your components

Navigate into the `src` directory and start adding your Javascript components to the project. Each component should be placed in its own directory with an associated story file.

For example, if you have a component named `Button`, create a directory named `Button` inside the `src` directory. Inside this directory, create a file named `Button.js` for your component code, and another file named `Button.stories.js` for your Storybook story.

## Step 4: Run Storybook

To run Storybook, use the following command:

```
npm run storybook
```

This command will start the Storybook development server and open it in your default browser. You can view your components and interact with them in isolation.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a project with Storybook for developing and testing Javascript components. You can now start building and documenting your components using the power of Storybook.

Remember to regularly update your `package.json` file with the project dependencies and scripts as needed. Happy coding! #javascript #storybook
