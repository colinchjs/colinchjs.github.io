Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker tricks a user into performing an unwanted action on a trusted website, without their knowledge or consent. CSRF attacks can have serious consequences, from financial damage to data breaches.

In this article, we will explore some real-world examples of successful CSRF attacks in JavaScript applications and discuss the preventive measures that can be taken to mitigate such attacks.

## Example 1: Unauthorized Fund Transfer

Consider a banking application that allows users to transfer funds between their accounts. The vulnerable endpoint `/transfer` accepts a POST request containing the source account, destination account, and the transfer amount.

```javascript
app.post('/transfer', (req, res) => {
  const sourceAccount = req.body.sourceAccount;
  const destinationAccount = req.body.destinationAccount;
  const transferAmount = req.body.transferAmount;

  // Perform fund transfer logic
});
```

In a CSRF attack, the attacker may create a malicious webpage that contains a form pre-filled with data, designed to transfer funds to their own account. When an unsuspecting user visits this webpage while authenticated in their banking application, the browser will automatically submit the form, performing the fund transfer without the user's knowledge.

To prevent such attacks, the application should implement measures like **CSRF tokens**. A CSRF token is a unique value assigned to each user session and is included as a hidden field in every form. When a form is submitted, the application checks the validity of the CSRF token, ensuring that the request was intentionally made by the user.

## Example 2: Unauthorized Profile Update

Consider a social media application that allows users to update their profile information. The vulnerable endpoint `/profile` accepts a POST request containing the user's new profile data.

```javascript
app.post('/profile', (req, res) => {
  const newProfileData = req.body;

  // Update the user's profile with new data
});
```

In a CSRF attack, the attacker may lure the user into visiting a malicious website that includes an invisible iframe pointing to the `/profile` endpoint. Since the user is already authenticated in the social media application, the browser automatically sends the POST request to update the user's profile, without their knowledge.

To prevent such attacks, the application can use the **SameSite** attribute for session cookies. By setting the SameSite attribute to 'Strict' or 'Lax', the browser will enforce that cookies are only sent in first-party context, preventing the cross-origin requests made in CSRF attacks.

## Conclusion

These examples illustrate how easily CSRF attacks can be carried out in JavaScript applications, potentially leading to unauthorized actions and compromising user data. It is crucial to implement preventive measures like CSRF tokens and SameSite attributes to mitigate the risk of such attacks. By doing so, we can ensure the security and trustworthiness of our web applications.
