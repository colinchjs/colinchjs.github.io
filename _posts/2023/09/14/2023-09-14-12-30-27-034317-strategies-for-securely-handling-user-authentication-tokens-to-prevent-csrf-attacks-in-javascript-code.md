One of the critical aspects of web application security is preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. CSRF attacks occur when an attacker tricks a user's browser into performing an unwanted action on a different website that the user is authenticated to. To mitigate this risk, it's crucial to implement secure practices when handling user authentication tokens in JavaScript code. In this article, we will discuss some strategies to ensure the security of user authentication tokens in JavaScript.

## 1. **Use SameSite attribute in Cookies**

The SameSite attribute for cookies is a preventive measure against CSRF attacks. It allows developers to specify whether a cookie should be sent with cross-site requests. By setting the SameSite attribute to "Strict" or "Lax" for authentication cookies, you can restrict their usage to same-site requests only, preventing them from being sent during cross-site requests.

```javascript
// Setting SameSite attribute to "Strict" for cookie
response.cookie('auth_token', token, { sameSite: 'Strict' });

// Setting SameSite attribute to "Lax" for cookie
response.cookie('auth_token', token, { sameSite: 'Lax' });
```

## 2. **Implement CSRF Tokens**

Using CSRF tokens is an effective defense mechanism against CSRF attacks. By including a unique token with every request that modifies user state (such as POST, DELETE, or PUT requests), you can verify the authenticity of the request on the server-side. The token should be unpredictable and generated per session or per form submission.

```javascript
// Generate and include CSRF token in AJAX request header
function sendAjaxRequest() {
  const csrfToken = getCSRFToken();
  const headers = { 'X-CSRF-Token': csrfToken };

  // Send AJAX request with CSRF token in header
  // ...
}

// Verify CSRF token on the server-side for sensitive operations
app.post('/updateProfile', (req, res) => {
  if (validateCSRFToken(req.headers['x-csrf-token'])) {
    // Proceed with updating the user profile
    // ...
  } else {
    // CSRF token mismatch, reject the request
    // ...
  }
});
```

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly enhance the security of authentication tokens in JavaScript code and protect your web application against CSRF attacks. Remember to regularly review and update your security practices to stay ahead of evolving threats.
