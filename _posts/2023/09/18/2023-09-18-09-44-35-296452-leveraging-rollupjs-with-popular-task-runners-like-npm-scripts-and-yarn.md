In modern web development, it is crucial to have an efficient build process to bundle and optimize our code. Rollup.js is a popular JavaScript module bundler that leverages the ES6 module syntax to create smaller and faster bundles. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate Rollup.js with two popular task runners: npm scripts and yarn.

## npm scripts

npm, the default package manager for Node.js, provides a simple way to define custom scripts in the `package.json` file. These scripts can be executed using the `npm run` command. To use Rollup.js with npm scripts, we first need to install it as a dev dependency by running the following command:

```shell
npm install rollup --save-dev
```

Once Rollup.js is installed, we can add a script in the `package.json` file to execute Rollup.js with the desired configuration. Here is an example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c"
  }
}
```

In this script, `-c` is a flag that tells Rollup.js to use a `rollup.config.js` file for configuring the bundling process. We can create this file in the root of our project and define the input and output options for Rollup.js.

## Yarn

Yarn, another popular package manager, is known for its speed and reliability. It is compatible with the npm ecosystem, which means we can use Rollup.js with yarn in a similar way.

To use Rollup.js with yarn, we need to install it as a dev dependency by running the following command:

```shell
yarn add rollup --dev
```

Once Rollup.js is installed, we can define a script in the `package.json` file to execute Rollup.js, similar to what we did with npm scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c"
  }
}
```

The `rollup -c` command is the same as before, and Rollup.js will use the `rollup.config.js` file for configuration.

## Conclusion

Rollup.js is a powerful tool for optimizing and bundling JavaScript code. By leveraging npm scripts or yarn, we can easily integrate Rollup.js into our build process and take advantage of its performance benefits. Whichever task runner you choose, make sure to update the scripts in your `package.json` file accordingly to suit your specific needs.
