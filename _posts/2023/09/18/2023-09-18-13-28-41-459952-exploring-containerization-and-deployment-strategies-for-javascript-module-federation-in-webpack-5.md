The rise of microfrontend architecture has paved the way for new techniques and tools to manage and deploy modularized JavaScript applications. One such tool is **JavaScript Module Federation**, introduced in **Webpack 5**, which allows us to dynamically load modules from different applications at runtime.

In this blog post, we will explore containerization and deployment strategies for applications that utilize JavaScript Module Federation in Webpack 5.

## Containerization with Docker

Containerization provides a great way to package and isolate our applications, making them portable and easy to deploy. Docker is a popular containerization platform that enables us to create containers for our applications.

To containerize an application that uses JavaScript Module Federation, we need to:

1. Create a Dockerfile: We start by defining a Dockerfile that specifies the base image, sets up the environment, and copies the necessary files into the container.

2. Build the Docker image: Next, we build the Docker image using the Dockerfile. This process includes installing dependencies, building the application, and configuring the necessary runtime environment.

3. Run the container: Finally, we run the containerized application using the Docker image. We can expose specific ports and configure networking options as per our requirements.

Containerization simplifies the deployment process and ensures consistency across different environments. With Docker, we can easily package and distribute our JavaScript Module Federation applications.

## Deployment strategies

Once we have containerized our application, we can explore different deployment strategies based on our use case and infrastructure.

Here are two common deployment strategies:

### 1. Single container deployment

In this strategy, we deploy each containerized application independently. Each application has its own container, which can be scaled independently based on the workload. This strategy is suitable for small to medium-sized projects or when we want to isolate individual applications.

To deploy the containers, we can use container orchestration platforms like **Docker Swarm** or **Kubernetes**. These platforms provide robust features for managing and scaling containers in a distributed environment.

### 2. Multi-container deployment

In a large-scale project, we may have multiple containerized applications working together. In this case, we can deploy all the containers as part of a single application stack. This strategy simplifies the deployment process and ensures all the applications work together seamlessly.

To deploy a multi-container application, we can utilize container orchestration platforms like **Docker Compose** or **Kubernetes**. These platforms allow us to define a declarative configuration file that specifies the container dependencies and orchestration rules.

## Conclusion

JavaScript Module Federation in Webpack 5 opens up new possibilities for building modularized applications. By containerizing and deploying our applications using strategies like Docker and container orchestration platforms, we can improve scalability, portability, and maintainability.

Containerization with Docker provides an excellent way to package and isolate our applications, while deployment strategies like single container or multi-container deployments enable us to manage and scale our applications effectively.

With the right containerization and deployment strategies in place, we can harness the full potential of JavaScript Module Federation and build robust, scalable applications.
