Memoization is a technique used in programming to optimize the execution time of a function by caching its results. By storing the results of expensive function calls and returning them when the same inputs occur again, we can significantly improve the performance of our code.

In JavaScript, we can use the Proxy object to implement transparent memoization. The Proxy object allows us to intercept and customize the behavior of fundamental operations, such as property lookup and function invocation.

## Creating a Memoization Proxy

To create a memoization proxy, we will define a `memoize` function that takes another function as its argument. This `memoize` function will return a proxy object that intercepts function calls and caches the results.

```javascript
function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = new Map();

  return new Proxy(fn, {
    apply: (target, thisArg, args) => {
      const cacheKey = JSON.stringify(args);
      
      if (cache.has(cacheKey)) {
        return cache.get(cacheKey);
      }
      
      const result = target.apply(thisArg, args);
      cache.set(cacheKey, result);
      
      return result;
    }
  });
}
```

## How It Works

In the `memoize` function above, we create a new Map object named `cache` to store the function results keyed by argument values.

Next, we create a Proxy object that intercepts function calls using the `apply` trap. The `apply` trap is called whenever a function is invoked. 

Inside the `apply` trap, we stringify the `args` array to generate a cache key. We then check if the cache already has a result for this key. If it does, we return the cached result. Otherwise, we invoke the original function `target` with the given arguments and store the result in the cache.

Finally, we return the result of the function call.

## Using the Memoization Proxy

To use the memoization proxy, we simply need to pass our function through the `memoize` function.

```javascript
function expensiveCalculation(n) {
  console.log('Performing expensive calculation...');
  return n * 2;
}

const memoizedCalculation = memoize(expensiveCalculation);

console.log(memoizedCalculation(5)); // Performing expensive calculation... 10
console.log(memoizedCalculation(5)); // 10 (result is cached, so no expensive calculation is performed)
```

In the example above, the `expensiveCalculation` function is wrapped in the `memoize` function, creating a memoization proxy. The first call to `memoizedCalculation(5)` triggers the expensive calculation and returns `10`. However, the second call with the same argument simply retrieves the result from the cache without executing the expensive calculation again.

## Conclusion

Using the Proxy object in JavaScript, we can easily implement transparent memoization to optimize function calls. By caching the results of expensive calculations, we can enhance the performance of our code significantly. The memoization proxy intercepts function calls and transparently handles the caching behind the scenes, making it a powerful tool for optimization.
