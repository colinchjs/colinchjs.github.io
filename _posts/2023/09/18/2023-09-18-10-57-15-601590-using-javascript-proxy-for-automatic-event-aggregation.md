As developers, we often come across scenarios where we need to aggregate events from multiple sources into a single handler. Traditionally, achieving this would require manually adding event listeners to each source and then dispatching the aggregated event. However, JavaScript provides a powerful feature called **Proxy** that simplifies this process by allowing us to define custom behavior for fundamental operations on an object, such as property access or function invocation.

In this article, we'll explore how we can leverage the Proxy object in JavaScript to automatically aggregate events from multiple sources into a single handler.

## How does it work?

To begin, let's define a simple scenario where we have two event sources: `sourceA` and `sourceB`. We want to aggregate events emitted by both sources into a single handler called `eventHandler`. 

Here's an example of how we can achieve this using a Proxy object:

```javascript
const eventHandler = (eventName, eventData) => {
  console.log(`Event received: ${eventName}`, eventData);
};

const sourceA = new EventSourceA();
const sourceB = new EventSourceB();

const proxy = new Proxy({}, {
  get(target, prop) {
    if (prop === 'addEventListener') {
      return (eventName, callback) => {
        sourceA.addEventListener(eventName, callback);
        sourceB.addEventListener(eventName, callback);
      };
    }
    return Reflect.get(target, prop);
  },
});

proxy.addEventListener('click', eventHandler);
```

In this example, we create a Proxy object with a `get` trap. The `get` trap is triggered whenever we try to access a property on the Proxy object. Inside the `get` trap, we check if the property being accessed is `addEventListener`. If it is, we return a function that adds the given event listener to both `sourceA` and `sourceB`.

By using the Proxy object, we get automatic event aggregation without having to manually add event listeners to each source.

## Advantages of using Proxy for event aggregation

1. **Simplified event handling**: With Proxy, we can centralize the event aggregation logic and handle events from multiple sources in a single place. This makes our code more organized and easier to maintain.

2. **Dynamic event aggregation**: The Proxy object allows us to dynamically add and remove event sources without modifying the event aggregation logic. This flexibility is especially useful when working with a dynamic set of event sources.

3. **Performance optimizations**: The Proxy object provides hooks for intercepting object operations, which opens up possibilities for performance optimizations. For example, we can cache event listeners or implement debouncing/throttling mechanisms to handle frequent events more efficiently.

## Conclusion

JavaScript's Proxy object provides a powerful way to automate event aggregation from multiple sources. By leveraging the Proxy's `get` trap, we can dynamically add event listeners to multiple sources and aggregate events without manual intervention. This approach simplifies our code, improves maintainability, and allows for more flexibility in handling events.

So, next time you encounter a scenario where you need to aggregate events, consider using the Proxy object to automate the process and make your code more elegant.
