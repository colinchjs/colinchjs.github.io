Event logging is a crucial aspect of any application, as it helps developers track and analyze important events that occur during runtime. JavaScript provides several ways to implement event logging, and one powerful approach is through the use of proxies.

Proxies in JavaScript act as intermediaries between an object and the code accessing that object. We can leverage this feature to intercept method calls and log events whenever these methods are invoked. Let's dive into an example of how to implement proxy-based event logging in JavaScript.

### Step 1: Create an Event Logger

First, we need to create a simple logger that will handle the event logging. Let's create a basic `EventLogger` class that can log events to the console:

```javascript
class EventLogger {
  log(event) {
    console.log(`Event Logged: ${event}`);
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Create a Proxy

Next, we'll create the proxy object using the `Proxy` class provided by JavaScript. This proxy object will intercept method calls and log the corresponding events. In our example, we'll create a `LoggedProxy` that wraps an original object and logs events when any of its methods are invoked:

```javascript
function createLoggedProxy(object, eventLogger) {
  return new Proxy(object, {
    get(target, propKey, receiver) {
      const originalMethod = target[propKey];
      if (typeof originalMethod === 'function') {
        return function (...args) {
          eventLogger.log(`Method '${propKey}' called with arguments: ${args}`);
          return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
        };
      }
      return originalMethod;
    },
  });
}
```

### Step 3: Usage

Now, let's see how we can use the proxy to log events on method calls. We'll create a simple `User` class with a few methods that we want to log:

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  }

  sayAge(age) {
    console.log(`I am ${age} years old.`);
  }
}
```

To apply the event logging functionality to the `User` class, we'll create an instance of `EventLogger` and use it to create a logged proxy of the `User` object:

```javascript
const user = new User('John');
const eventLogger = new EventLogger();
const loggedUser = createLoggedProxy(user, eventLogger);

loggedUser.greet();
// Output: Event Logged: Method 'greet' called with arguments: []

loggedUser.sayAge(25);
// Output: Event Logged: Method 'sayAge' called with arguments: [25]
```

As you can see, the event logger successfully logged the method calls along with their respective arguments.

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement proxy-based event logging in JavaScript. By utilizing proxies, we can intercept and log events whenever methods on an object are invoked. This technique can be a powerful tool for logging and debugging in complex JavaScript applications.
