Undo/redo functionality is a common requirement in many applications, allowing users to reverse or redo their actions. In JavaScript, we can implement this functionality using the Proxy object, which allows us to intercept and customize the behavior of object operations.

## How It Works

To implement undo/redo functionality using proxies, we need three main components:

1. **State object**: This object holds the data that will be modified during user interactions.
2. **Actions object**: This object defines the functions that the user can execute to modify the state object.
3. **Proxy object**: We create a proxy around the state object that intercepts the actions executed by the user. This proxy keeps track of the actions and allows us to undo or redo them.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the state object:

```javascript
const state = {
  value: 0,
};
```

2. Create the actions object:

```javascript
const actions = {
  increment: function (amount) {
    state.value += amount;
  },
  decrement: function (amount) {
    state.value -= amount;
  },
};
```

3. Create the proxy object:

```javascript
const history = [];
const stateProxy = new Proxy(state, {
  set: function (target, property, value) {
    if (target[property] !== value) {
      history.push({ property, previousValue: target[property], newValue: value });
      target[property] = value;
    }
    return true;
  },
});
```

4. Add undo and redo functions to the actions object:

```javascript
actions.undo = function () {
  const lastAction = history.pop();
  if (lastAction) {
    stateProxy[lastAction.property] = lastAction.previousValue;
  }
};

actions.redo = function () {
  const nextAction = history[history.length - 1];
  if (nextAction) {
    stateProxy[nextAction.property] = nextAction.newValue;
  }
};
```

5. Test the functionality:

```javascript
console.log(state.value); // 0

actions.increment(5);
console.log(state.value); // 5

actions.increment(10);
console.log(state.value); // 15

actions.undo();
console.log(state.value); // 5

actions.redo();
console.log(state.value); // 15
```

## Conclusion

By using JavaScript proxies, we can easily implement undo/redo functionality in our applications. Proxies allow us to intercept and customize object operations, enabling us to track and reverse user actions. Incorporating this feature enhances the user experience and provides a more flexible interface for interacting with application state.
