One of the key features of JavaScript is its dynamic typing system, which allows variables to hold values of different types. However, there may be scenarios where you want automatic type conversions to occur when accessing or assigning values to an object.

JavaScript Proxy is a powerful feature that allows you to intercept and customize fundamental operations like property access and assignment. By using Proxy, you can implement automatic type conversions in a clean and elegant way.

## Creating a Type Conversion Proxy

To create a type conversion proxy, you first need to define a target object that will be wrapped by the proxy. This target object can be any JavaScript object or primitive value.

```javascript
const target = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isActive: true,
};
```

Next, you create a handler object that contains traps - special methods that intercept operations performed on the proxy. The `get` trap intercepts property access and the `set` trap intercepts property assignment.

```javascript
const handler = {
  get: function (target, prop) {
    if (typeof target[prop] === "function") {
      return target[prop]();
    }
    return target[prop];
  },
  set: function (target, prop, value) {
    if (typeof value === "string") {
      target[prop] = parseInt(value);
    } else {
      target[prop] = value;
    }
    return true;
  },
};
```

In the above example, the `get` trap checks if the accessed property is a function. If so, it invokes the function and returns its result. This allows you to call object methods directly on the proxy.

The `set` trap checks if the assigned value is a string. If it is, it converts the string to an integer using `parseInt()` before assigning it to the property. This enables automatic type conversion from string to number.

## Creating and Using the Proxy

To create the proxy, you simply pass the target object and the handler object to the `Proxy` constructor.

```javascript
const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
```

Now, you can interact with the proxy as if it were the original object, with the added benefit of automatic type conversions.

```javascript
console.log(proxy.name); // "John"

proxy.age = "25";
console.log(proxy.age); // 25 (automatically converted to number)
```

In the example above, when accessing `proxy.name`, the `get` trap in the handler intercepts the property access and returns the corresponding value from the target.

When assigning `"25"` to `proxy.age`, the `set` trap intercepts the assignment and automatically converts the string to a number before updating the value in the target object.

## Conclusion

Using JavaScript Proxy, you can seamlessly implement automatic type conversions when accessing or assigning values to an object. It provides a flexible and elegant way to customize fundamental operations, making your code more readable and maintainable.

By employing proxies, you can streamline your codebase and reduce the need for explicit type checks and conversions, enhancing the overall robustness and efficiency of your JavaScript applications.
