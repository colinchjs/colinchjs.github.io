In JavaScript, the `Proxy` object is a powerful feature that allows us to create virtual objects and intercept operations on them. By using a `Proxy`, we can define custom behavior for fundamental operations like property access, assignment, function invocation, and more. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as creating a wrapper around an existing object, adding validation or logging to property access, and even creating a completely virtual object.

To create a virtual object using the `Proxy` object, we need to define a target object and a handler object. The target object can be an existing object or a new object, and the handler object contains the traps for intercepting operations. Let's see an example.

```javascript
const virtualObject = new Proxy({}, {
    get(target, property) {
        // Custom behavior for property access
        console.log(`Getting "${property}" from virtual object`);
        return target[property];
    },
    set(target, property, value) {
        // Custom behavior for property assignment
        console.log(`Setting "${property}" in virtual object to "${value}"`);
        target[property] = value;
    },
    // Add other traps for different operations as needed
});

// Accessing a property on the virtual object
console.log(virtualObject.name); // Output: "Getting "name" from virtual object"

// Assigning a value to a property on the virtual object
virtualObject.age = 25; // Output: "Setting "age" in virtual object to "25""
```

In the above code, we create a new empty object as the target for our virtual object. Then, we define the handler object with traps for `get` and `set` operations. In this example, when we access a property on the `virtualObject`, the `get` trap intercepts the operation and logs a message before returning the value. Similarly, when we assign a value to a property on the `virtualObject`, the `set` trap intercepts the operation, logs a message, and sets the value on the target object.

We can add more traps to the handler object, such as `apply` for function invocation, `has` for checking property existence, and so on, to create more advanced virtual object behaviors.

Using JavaScript Proxy, we have the flexibility to define custom behavior for virtual objects, allowing us to create powerful abstractions and encapsulate complex logic. This can greatly enhance the versatility and maintainability of our JavaScript code.
