If you're a JavaScript developer, you're most likely familiar with Rollup.js, a popular bundler that offers a streamlined and efficient way to bundle your code for the web. One of the most exciting aspects of Rollup.js is its extensive ecosystem of plugins. In this blog post, we will explore some of the must-have plugins that can enhance your development experience and make your life easier. Let's dive in!

## CommonJS Plugin

One of the key strengths of Rollup.js is its support for ES modules (ESM). However, many existing JavaScript packages still use the CommonJS (CJS) format. That's where the **CommonJS plugin** comes in. This plugin allows you to import and bundle CJS modules seamlessly with your ESM code. With this plugin, you can enjoy the benefits of Rollup.js while still using your favorite CJS dependencies.

To install the CommonJS plugin, use the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @rollup/plugin-commonjs
```

Once installed, you can add it to your Rollup configuration file (usually named `rollup.config.js`) as follows:

```javascript
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs';

export default {
  // other Rollup options
  plugins: [
    // other plugins
    commonjs()
  ]
};
```

## Babel Plugin

When building modern JavaScript applications, you may find yourself using features that are not yet natively supported in all browsers. The **Babel plugin** allows you to transpile your code using Babel before bundling it with Rollup.js. This means you can write your code using the latest JavaScript syntax without worrying about browser compatibility.

To install the Babel plugin, use the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @rollup/plugin-babel @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

Then, in your Rollup configuration file, add the Babel plugin:

```javascript
import babel from '@rollup/plugin-babel';

export default {
  // other Rollup options
  plugins: [
    // other plugins
    babel({
      presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
    })
  ]
};
```

## Conclusion

These are just two of the many plugins available in the Rollup.js ecosystem. With plugins, you can tailor your bundling process to fit your specific needs and take advantage of additional features and optimizations. So go ahead and explore the wide variety of plugins available for Rollup.js, and take your JavaScript bundling to the next level!
