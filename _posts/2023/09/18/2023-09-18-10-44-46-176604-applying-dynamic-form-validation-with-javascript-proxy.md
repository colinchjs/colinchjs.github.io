In web development, form validation is a crucial aspect to ensure that user-submitted data is correct and valid. JavaScript offers various ways to implement form validation, and one approach is by using the Proxy object.

## Understanding the Proxy object

The Proxy object is a powerful feature introduced in ECMAScript 6. It allows you to intercept and customize fundamental operations performed on an object. By leveraging this capability, you can dynamically validate form inputs in real-time.

## Setting up the form

Let's start by creating a simple HTML form that we'll use as an example:

```html
<form id="myForm">
  <input type="text" name="fullName">
  <input type="email" name="email">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Implementing form validation with Proxy

To validate the form inputs, we'll create a Proxy object that will intercept the set operation for each input field. 

```javascript
const form = document.getElementById("myForm");

const formValidationHandler = {
  set(target, key, value) {
    // Implement your validation logic here
    if (key === "fullName") {
      // Validate full name format
    }
    if (key === "email") {
      // Validate email format
    }
    
    target[key] = value;
    
    return true;
  }
};

const proxiedForm = new Proxy(form, formValidationHandler);
```

In the `formValidationHandler`, we can define our validation logic for each input field. If the user input satisfies the validation requirements, we set the value on the original form object using `target[key] = value`. This allows the user input to be stored in the form object as usual. If the validation fails, you can display an error message or perform any other desired action.

## Listening for form submission

To listen for form submission and prevent it from happening if there are validation errors, you can add an event listener to the form:

```javascript
form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  
  // Perform additional validation, if required
  
  // Submit the form if validation passes
  form.submit();
});
```

In the event listener, you can perform additional validation if necessary. If everything passes, you can call `form.submit()` to submit the form normally. Otherwise, you can display error messages or take any other desired action.

## Conclusion

By using the Proxy object in JavaScript, we can implement dynamic form validation that intercepts and validates user input in real-time. This approach offers flexibility and customization, allowing you to define validation logic specific to each form field.
