JavaScript Proxy is a powerful feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 that allows us to intercept and customize operations on objects. It provides a way to define custom behavior for fundamental object operations, such as property access, assignment, deletion, and more.

While JavaScript Proxy brings great flexibility and control over how objects behave, there are some traps or pitfalls that developers should be aware of. In this blog post, we will explore some of these traps to help you avoid common mistakes and pitfalls when working with Proxy objects.

### 1. Trap 1: Forgetting to handle non-configurable properties

When using a Proxy, it is essential to remember that non-configurable properties cannot be modified. If you attempt to modify a non-configurable property using a Proxy, it will throw an error unless you explicitly handle it in the corresponding trap.

To handle non-configurable properties, we can use the `Object.defineProperty` method within the Proxy's `set` trap. By checking the `configurable` attribute of the property, we can decide whether to allow or reject the modification.

```javascript
const target = { prop: 'value' };
Object.defineProperty(target, 'prop', { configurable: false });

const proxyHandler = {
  set(target, key, value) {
    const descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(target, key);
    if (!descriptor.configurable) {
      throw new Error('Cannot modify a non-configurable property');
    }
    target[key] = value;
    return true;
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, proxyHandler);
proxy.prop = 'new value'; // Throws an error!
```

### 2. Trap 2: Infinite recursion in trapping methods

Another common trap when working with Proxy objects is the risk of falling into an infinite recursion loop, especially when trapping methods like `get` or `set`.

To avoid infinite recursion, we should ensure that our trap implementations don't unintentionally trigger the same operation they are intercepting. One possible solution is to use the `Reflect` object to invoke the default behavior of the trapped operation.

```javascript
const target = { prop: 'value' };

const proxyHandler = {
  get(target, key) {
    if (key === 'prop') {
      return 'custom value';
    }
    return Reflect.get(target, key);
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, proxyHandler);
console.log(proxy.prop); // Outputs "custom value"
console.log(proxy.unknownProp); // Outputs undefined
```

By using `Reflect.get(target, key)`, we ensure that the default behavior of property access is preserved and avoid getting stuck in an infinite recursion loop.

### Conclusion

JavaScript Proxy is a powerful tool that empowers us to redefine and customize object behavior. However, it is essential to be aware of the traps and pitfalls that come with using Proxy objects. By understanding these traps and implementing appropriate handling mechanisms, we can harness the full potential of JavaScript Proxy without stumbling upon unexpected errors or infinite recursion.
