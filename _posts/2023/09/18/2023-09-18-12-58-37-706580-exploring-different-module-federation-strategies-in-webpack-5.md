Webpack is a popular module bundler that allows developers to bundle and manage their JavaScript modules. One of the exciting features introduced in Webpack 5 is module federation, which allows multiple applications to share and consume modules from each other.

Module federation is a game-changer for microfrontends and component libraries, as it enables decoupled development and deployment of different parts of a web application. In this blog post, we will explore different strategies for implementing module federation in Webpack 5.

## 1. Single Remote

The single remote strategy involves exposing a single remote entry point that provides access to shared modules. This strategy is suitable when you have a single application acting as the host, and other applications consuming the shared modules.

Here's an example of how to configure module federation for the single remote strategy in `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container;

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'host',
      remotes: {
        remoteApp: 'remoteApp@https://remote-app-url/remoteEntry.js',
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

## 2. Multiple Remotes

The multiple remotes strategy involves exposing multiple remote entry points, each with its own shared modules. This strategy is suitable when you have multiple independent applications, each providing its own shared modules.

Here's an example of how to configure module federation for the multiple remotes strategy in `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container;

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'host',
      remotes: {
        app1: 'app1@https://app1-url/remoteEntry.js',
        app2: 'app2@https://app2-url/remoteEntry.js',
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

These are just two of the many strategies you can use to implement module federation in Webpack 5. Depending on your project's requirements and architecture, you can choose the most suitable strategy.

By leveraging module federation, you can build scalable and maintainable web applications that consist of decoupled modules developed by different teams. Experiment with these strategies and choose the one that best fits your needs.
