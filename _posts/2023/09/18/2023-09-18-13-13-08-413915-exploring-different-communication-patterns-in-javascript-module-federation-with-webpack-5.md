With the release of Webpack 5, the JavaScript Module Federation feature has gained a lot of attention. It allows you to share code between JavaScript applications and build federated modules that can be loaded and executed in different applications. One of the key aspects of Module Federation is communication between modules, which can be achieved through different patterns. Let's explore some common communication patterns and see how they can be implemented.

## 1. Shared dependencies

One way to enable communication between federated modules is to share dependencies. When a module depends on another federated module, it can specify the shared dependencies that need to be loaded. The shared dependencies are resolved by the consuming application, ensuring that only one instance of each dependency is loaded, reducing duplication.

```javascript
const exposedModule = {
  // Expose shared dependencies
  shared: {
    react: { eager: true },
    'react-dom': { eager: true },
  },
};
```

By sharing dependencies, the modules can communicate and share functionality. It is particularly useful when both modules need to access a shared state or use common utilities.

## 2. Remote Method Invocation (RMI)

RMI is another communication pattern that can be used with Module Federation. It allows calling functions remotely between federated modules. The consuming application can invoke methods implemented in remote modules, just like calling local functions. This pattern enables modules to interact with each other and exchange data.

```javascript
// Remote module exposing methods
const exposedModule = {
  // Expose methods
  remoteMethods: ['getUser', 'updateUser'],
};

// Consuming application
import { getUser, updateUser } from 'remote-module';
getUser()
  .then(user => {
    // Do something with the user data
    updateUser({ name: 'John Doe' });
  });
```

RMI provides a seamless way for modules to communicate and collaborate. It allows for the decoupling of functionality, making it easier to manage and maintain large-scale applications.

## Conclusion

JavaScript Module Federation with Webpack 5 brings powerful capabilities for building distributed applications. By exploring different communication patterns, such as shared dependencies and remote method invocation, modules can interact and exchange data. This promotes modularity and code reuse, enabling developers to build complex applications with ease.
