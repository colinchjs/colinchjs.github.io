With the introduction of Webpack 5, **JavaScript Module Federation** has become a powerful feature to integrate legacy applications. It allows you to **share and consume modules across different applications** in a more efficient and flexible way.

## What is JavaScript Module Federation?

JavaScript Module Federation is a feature introduced in Webpack 5 that enables you to dynamically load and share JavaScript modules across different applications. It solves the problem of creating standalone applications that can maintain their own codebase while **sharing modules with other applications**.

## Why use JavaScript Module Federation?

Integrating legacy applications with JavaScript Module Federation has several benefits:

1. **Code sharing**: You can share modules across multiple applications without duplicating code or dependencies, reducing both development and maintenance efforts.

2. **Version independence**: Each application can maintain its own version of a shared module, allowing for independent updates and avoiding version conflicts.

3. **Isolation**: Each application can encapsulate its own state and logic, providing better isolation and reducing the risk of side effects.

## Integrating JavaScript Module Federation with legacy applications

To integrate JavaScript Module Federation with legacy applications in Webpack 5, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Module Federation** in your Webpack configuration file of the legacy application using the `ModuleFederationPlugin`. Configure the `name`, `filename`, `remotes`, and `exposes` options to specify the modules you want to share and consume.

   ```javascript
   // webpack.config.js
   const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container;

   module.exports = {
     // ...
     plugins: [
       new ModuleFederationPlugin({
         name: 'legacyApp',
         filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
         remotes: {
           sharedApp: 'sharedApp@https://example.com/sharedApp/remoteEntry.js',
         },
         exposes: {
           './sharedComponent': './src/sharedComponent',
         },
       }),
     ],
   };
   ```

2. **Build and deploy** the legacy application using the updated Webpack configuration. This will generate the `remoteEntry.js` file, which contains the code necessary to consume modules from remote applications.

3. **Import and use remote modules** in your legacy application. You can use the syntax `import('sharedApp/sharedComponent')` to dynamically load and use modules from the shared application.

   ```javascript
   // index.js
   import('sharedApp/sharedComponent').then((module) => {
     const sharedComponent = module.default;
     // Use the shared component in your legacy application
   });
   ```

4. **Deploy and load** the shared application and the legacy application together. The legacy application will fetch the `remoteEntry.js` file from the shared application's URL and dynamically load the shared modules.

   ```html
   <!-- index.html -->
   <script src="https://example.com/sharedApp/remoteEntry.js"></script>
   <script src="legacyApp.js"></script>
   ```

## Conclusion

JavaScript Module Federation in Webpack 5 provides a powerful mechanism to integrate legacy applications. By leveraging code sharing, version independence, and isolation, you can enhance your development process and improve application architecture.
