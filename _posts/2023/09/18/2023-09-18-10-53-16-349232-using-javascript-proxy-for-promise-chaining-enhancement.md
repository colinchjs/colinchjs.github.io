Promises are a powerful tool in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. They allow us to write clean and readable code by chaining multiple asynchronous operations together. However, sometimes we may need to add additional functionality to our promise chaining. This is where JavaScript Proxy comes in handy.

JavaScript Proxy is a feature introduced in ES6 that allows us to intercept and customize the behavior of fundamental operations on objects. By using a Proxy, we can enhance the promise chaining mechanism by adding new methods or modifying existing methods.

## Scenario

Let's consider a scenario where we have a chain of promises, and we want to add some logging functionality every time any of the promises are resolved or rejected. We can achieve this by creating a Proxy object that wraps around our promise chain.

## Implementing the Proxy

```javascript
const promiseChain = new Proxy(Promise, {
  apply: function(target, thisArg, args) {
    const promise = new target(...args);

    promise.then(() => {
      console.log("Promise resolved");
    }).catch(() => {
      console.log("Promise rejected");
    });

    return promise;
  },
});
```

In the above code snippet, we define a Proxy object named `promiseChain` that intercepts the creation of new promises. The `apply` method is triggered whenever a new promise is created using the `Promise` constructor. Inside the `apply` method, we create a new promise using `new target(...args)` and attach a `then` and `catch` callback to log whether the promise is resolved or rejected.

## Using the Proxy

Now, instead of using the `Promise` constructor directly, we will use our `promiseChain` Proxy object to create promises and automatically add the logging functionality.

```javascript
promiseChain.resolve("Hello").then((value) => {
  console.log(value);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

In the above example, we use the `promiseChain` Proxy object to create a promise and pass "Hello" as the resolved value. When the promise is resolved, the value is logged to the console. If the promise is rejected, the error is logged to the console.

## Conclusion

Using JavaScript Proxy, we can enhance the promise chaining mechanism by adding additional functionality without modifying the original promise code. This allows us to keep our code clean and modular, making it easier to maintain and extend.

With the power of JavaScript Proxy, we can customize and extend various JavaScript features, opening up new possibilities for enhancing our code. By leveraging proxies, we can add additional behaviors or modify existing behavior to suit our specific requirements.
