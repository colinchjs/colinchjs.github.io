In JavaScript projects, maintaining clean and consistent code is crucial for code readability, collaboration, and overall project health. To achieve this, **code linting and formatting** play a vital role. Linting helps catch common errors and enforces coding standards, while formatting ensures code is properly organized and styled.

While there are several linting and formatting tools available, **Rollup.js** offers a streamlined approach to include these capabilities directly into your build process. With the help of Rollup.js plugins, you can easily integrate popular linting and formatting tools and ensure that your code stays clean and error-free throughout development.

Let's explore some popular Rollup.js plugins for code linting and formatting:

## 1. rollup-plugin-eslint

**`rollup-plugin-eslint`** is a Rollup.js plugin that integrates the popular **ESLint** tool into your build process. It enables you to perform static analysis of your JavaScript code and enforce best practices, coding conventions, and code quality rules.

To use `rollup-plugin-eslint`, add it to your Rollup.js configuration:

```javascript
import { eslint } from 'rollup-plugin-eslint';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // other plugins...
    eslint()
  ]
};
```

By configuring the `.eslintrc` file in your project, you can define linting rules and customize them according to your needs. Running your Rollup.js build with this plugin will automatically trigger the linting process and display any errors or warnings in the console.

## 2. rollup-plugin-prettier

**`rollup-plugin-prettier`** is another powerful Rollup.js plugin that integrates the **Prettier** code formatter into your build process. Prettier helps maintain consistent code style by formatting your JavaScript code automatically according to a predefined set of rules.

To use `rollup-plugin-prettier`, add it to your Rollup.js configuration:

```javascript
import { prettier } from 'rollup-plugin-prettier';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // other plugins...
    prettier()
  ]
};
```

You can customize the formatting rules by providing a `.prettierrc` file in your project, or through other configurations such as `.prettierrc.js` or `package.json`. On running your Rollup.js build, this plugin will automatically format your code according to the defined rules, ensuring clean and consistent formatting across your project.

## Conclusion

By leveraging Rollupt.js plugins like `rollup-plugin-eslint` and `rollup-plugin-prettier`, you can seamlessly integrate code linting and formatting into your JavaScript project build process. This helps maintain code quality, consistency, and makes collaboration among team members easier. Remember to regularly run your builds to catch any linting errors and ensure code formatting remains consistent.
