When working on multiple JavaScript projects, it can be tedious to set up and configure Rollup.js for each project individually. Rollup.js is a popular module bundler that helps optimize and bundle your JavaScript code.

To improve productivity and avoid duplication of effort, it's a good idea to create reusable Rollup.js configurations that can be shared across multiple projects. This allows you to centralize your build configuration, making it easier to maintain and update.

## Setting up a shared Rollup.js configuration

To get started, create a separate directory for your shared Rollup.js configurations. This directory will contain all the necessary files and configuration options needed for building your JavaScript projects.

In this example, let's assume you have a `rollup-config` directory at the root of your project.

Inside the `rollup-config` directory, create a `rollup.config.js` file. This file will contain the main configuration for your Rollup.js build process.

```javascript
// rollup-config/rollup.config.js
import babel from 'rollup-plugin-babel';
import resolve from 'rollup-plugin-node-resolve';
import commonjs from 'rollup-plugin-commonjs';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    file: 'dist/bundle.js',
    format: 'umd',
    name: 'MyLibrary',
    sourcemap: true,
  },
  plugins: [
    resolve(),
    commonjs(),
    babel({
      exclude: 'node_modules/**',
    }),
  ],
};
```

In this configuration, we are using some popular Rollup.js plugins like `rollup-plugin-babel`, `rollup-plugin-node-resolve`, and `rollup-plugin-commonjs`. Feel free to add or remove plugins based on your project's needs.

## Using the shared configuration in multiple projects

Now that you have your shared Rollup.js configuration, you can easily reuse it in multiple JavaScript projects.

To use the shared configuration, navigate to your project's root directory and install the necessary Rollup.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install rollup rollup-plugin-babel rollup-plugin-node-resolve rollup-plugin-commonjs --save-dev
```

Next, create a `rollup.config.js` file in your project's root directory and import the shared configuration from the `rollup-config` directory:

```javascript
// rollup.config.js
import sharedConfig from '../rollup-config/rollup.config.js';

export default sharedConfig;
```

By importing the shared configuration, you can now leverage all the settings and plugins defined in the shared `rollup.config.js` file. If needed, you can customize the configuration further to suit your specific project requirements.

## Conclusion

Creating reusable Rollup.js configurations for multiple JavaScript projects can greatly simplify your build process and enhance productivity. By centralizing your build configuration, you can easily maintain and update your Rollup.js settings across different projects.

Remember to keep your shared configuration directory well-organized and modular. This will allow you to easily add or remove plugins or modify build options as your projects evolve.

By following this approach, you'll save time and effort in configuring Rollup.js for each individual project while maintaining consistency and efficiency across your codebase.
