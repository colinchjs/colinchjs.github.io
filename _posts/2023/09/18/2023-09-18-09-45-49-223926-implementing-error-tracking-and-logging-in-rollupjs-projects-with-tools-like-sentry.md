Error tracking and logging are essential for monitoring and debugging web applications. In Rollup.js projects, we can integrate tools like Sentry to capture and analyze errors that occur during runtime. In this blog post, we'll explore how to implement error tracking and logging in Rollup.js projects using Sentry.

## What is Sentry?

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is an open-source error tracking and logging platform that helps developers identify, prioritize, and resolve issues in their applications. It supports various programming languages and frameworks, including Rollup.js.

## Setting up a Rollup.js Project

Before we integrate Sentry into our Rollup.js project, let's set up a basic Rollup.js project structure:

1. Create a new directory for your project: `mkdir rollup-project`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd rollup-project`
3. Initialize a new `package.json` file: `npm init -y`
4. Install Rollup.js as a dev dependency: `npm install --save-dev rollup`

## Integrating Sentry into Rollup.js

To integrate Sentry into our Rollup.js project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a Sentry account if you don't have one already.
2. Create a new project in Sentry and obtain the corresponding DSN (Data Source Name).
3. Install the Sentry Rollup integration plugin: `npm install --save-dev @sentry/rollup`
4. Import and configure Sentry in your Rollup configuration file (`rollup.config.js`):

```javascript
import { sentry } from '@sentry/rollup';

export default {
  // other Rollup configuration options

  plugins: [
    // other Rollup plugins
    sentry({
      dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN', // Replace with your Sentry DSN
      include: ['./dist/bundle.js'], // Replace with the path to your bundled JS file
    }),
  ],
};
```

5. Build your Rollup project: `npx rollup -c`

## Capturing and Reporting Errors

With Sentry integrated into our Rollup.js project, we can now capture and report errors using the Sentry SDK. Here's an example of how we can capture and report an error:

```javascript
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error);
}
```

Make sure to import the Sentry SDK and initialize it with your DSN at the entry point of your application, such as `index.js`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({ dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN' }); // Replace with your Sentry DSN

// Other application code
```

## Conclusion

Integrating error tracking and logging into Rollup.js projects using tools like Sentry provides valuable insights into application issues, allowing developers to quickly identify and resolve them. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily implement error tracking and logging in your Rollup.js projects using Sentry. Happy coding and debugging!
