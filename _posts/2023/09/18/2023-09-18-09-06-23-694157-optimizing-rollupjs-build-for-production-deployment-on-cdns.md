Rollup.js is a popular JavaScript module bundler that allows developers to bundle their code into a single file, making it more efficient for production deployment. When deploying the bundled code onto a Content Delivery Network (CDN), it is crucial to optimize the build for better performance and faster delivery to end users. In this blog post, we will discuss some tips and techniques to optimize a Rollup.js build for production deployment on CDNs.

## 1. Minify JavaScript Code

Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from the JavaScript code, such as whitespace, comments, and unused code, to reduce the file size. This step can significantly improve the load time of your application. Rollup.js provides built-in support for minification through plugins like `rollup-plugin-terser`. To enable minification, add the following code to your `rollup.config.js` file:

```javascript
import { terser } from 'rollup-plugin-terser';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: {
    file: 'dist/bundle.js',
    format: 'iife',
  },
  plugins: [terser()],
};
```

By enabling minification, Rollup.js will automatically remove unnecessary characters from your code during the build process.

## 2. Enable Code Splitting

Code splitting is a technique that allows you to split your code into multiple smaller chunks, which can be loaded on-demand as needed. This helps to reduce the initial load time and improves the overall performance of your application. Rollup.js supports code splitting through plugins like `rollup-plugin-multi-entry`.

To enable code splitting, install the plugin using npm:

```
npm install rollup-plugin-multi-entry --save-dev
```

Then, update your `rollup.config.js` file as follows:

```javascript
import multiEntry from 'rollup-plugin-multi-entry';

export default {
  input: ['src/module1.js', 'src/module2.js'],
  output: {
    dir: 'dist',
    format: 'esm',
    sourcemap: true,
  },
  plugins: [multiEntry()],
};
```

By specifying an array of entry points, Rollup.js will generate multiple output chunks that can be loaded separately.

## Conclusion

Optimizing a Rollup.js build for production deployment on CDNs is essential for achieving better performance and faster delivery of your application. By following the tips mentioned in this blog post, such as enabling minification and code splitting, you can significantly improve the optimization of your Rollup.js build for deployment on CDNs.
