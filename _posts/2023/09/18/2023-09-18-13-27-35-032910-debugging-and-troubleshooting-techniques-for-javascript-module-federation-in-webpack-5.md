JavaScript Module Federation is a powerful feature introduced in Webpack 5, allowing you to share JavaScript modules between multiple projects. It enables you to create a federated architecture, where modules can be loaded and consumed across different applications.

However, like any complex technology, you might encounter issues while working with JavaScript Module Federation. In this blog post, we will explore some debugging and troubleshooting techniques to help you address common problems.

## 1. Inspect Remote Module Exports

When using JavaScript Module Federation, you might face issues related to exporting and importing modules. To debug these problems, you can inspect the remote module exports.

One way to inspect the remote module exports is by leveraging the `shareScope` provided by Webpack. You can access it from your browser's developer console by executing the following code:

```javascript
console.log(window["webpackShare"].default.RemoteModule)
```

This will give you insights into the exported variables and functions of the remote module and help you identify any inconsistencies or errors.

## 2. Check the Module Exposes Configuration

Another common issue with JavaScript Module Federation is misconfiguration of the `exposes` property in the module federation configuration. This can lead to errors when importing modules.

To troubleshoot this problem, you can verify that the `exposes` configuration is correct by checking the module federation manifest. The manifest file contains information about the exposed modules and their respective entry points.

Inspecting the manifest can be done using the following code:

```javascript
import('module-federation-manifest.json')
  .then((manifest) => {
    console.log(manifest)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error loading manifest', error)
  })
```

Analyzing the manifest will help you determine if the module is properly exposed and if the entry points are correctly defined.

## Conclusion

JavaScript Module Federation in Webpack 5 is a valuable tool for building federated architectures. However, it's essential to know how to debug and troubleshoot common issues that may arise during its implementation.

By following the debugging and troubleshooting techniques outlined in this blog post, you will be better equipped to overcome challenges and ensure a smooth integration of JavaScript Module Federation into your projects.
