Reactive forms are a powerful technique in web development that allows for dynamic and interactive user input. Traditionally, building reactive forms involved manually tracking and handling changes to form values. However, with the introduction of JavaScript Proxy objects, we can now build a more elegant and efficient solution.

## Why Use Proxy Objects?

Proxy objects in JavaScript provide an incredible amount of flexibility and control over object behavior. With proxies, we can intercept and modify property access behavior, which makes them ideal for building reactive forms. By leveraging proxies, we can create a form library that automatically updates and tracks form values as they change.

## The Basics

Let's start by creating a basic form library using proxies. First, we'll create a `createForm` function that takes an initial form state and returns a proxy object:

```javascript
const createForm = (initialState) => {
  const formState = { ...initialState };

  const formProxy = new Proxy(formState, {
    get(target, property) {
      // handle property access
      return target[property];
    },
    set(target, property, value) {
      // handle property assignment
      target[property] = value;
      // trigger form update logic
      // ...
      return true;
    },
  });

  return formProxy;
};
```

The `createForm` function creates a proxy object using `new Proxy`. We define two traps within the proxy - `get` and `set`. The `get` trap is responsible for handling property access, while the `set` trap is responsible for handling property assignment.

## Advanced Features

Now that we have a basic form library, let's add some advanced features. We can leverage the `set` trap to enhance our form library's capabilities:

### Validation

By adding validation logic to the `set` trap, we can automatically validate form inputs as they change:

```javascript
set(target, property, value) {
  if (property === 'email') {
    // validate email input
    if (!isValidEmail(value)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid email address');
    }
  }
  // handle property assignment and form update logic
  // ...
  return true;
}
```

### Dependency Tracking

Proxy objects also allow us to implement dependency tracking. By keeping track of which form fields depend on others, we can automatically update dependent fields when their dependencies change:

```javascript
set(target, property, value) {
  // handle property assignment and form update logic
  if (property === 'shippingAddress') {
    target['billingAddress'] = value;
  }
  // ...
  return true;
}
```

## Conclusion

Using JavaScript Proxy objects, we can create a powerful and efficient reactive form library. By intercepting property access and assignment, we can automate form updates, implement validation, and handle complex dependencies with ease. By leveraging the flexibility and control that proxies provide, building a proxy-based reactive form library becomes a straightforward task.
