In this blog post, we will dive into the world of JavaScript Module Federation and explore different routing strategies that can be used with Webpack 5. Module Federation is a feature introduced in Webpack 5 that allows you to dynamically load and share modules between multiple applications or micro frontends.

## What is JavaScript Module Federation?

JavaScript Module Federation is a concept that enables the sharing of JavaScript modules across different applications. It allows you to build scalable and modular web applications by dividing them into small, independently deployable micro frontends. Each of these micro frontends can be developed and maintained separately, and then seamlessly integrated into a single application.

## Why is routing important in Module Federation?

Routing is an essential aspect of any web application, as it determines how users navigate through different pages and views. When working with Module Federation, routing becomes even more critical, as each micro frontend may have its own routing requirements. Hence, it is crucial to choose the right routing strategy to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Different routing strategies for Module Federation

### 1. Single-SPA for centralized routing

One of the popular routing strategies for Module Federation is using Single-SPA, which is a JavaScript framework for orchestrating multiple JavaScript micro frontends into a single application. Single-SPA provides a centralized routing mechanism where all the routing logic is handled by a single router.

With Single-SPA, you can define routes for each micro frontend and handle navigation between them. The main advantage of this approach is that it provides a consistent user experience, as the routing logic is handled centrally. However, it requires additional configuration and setup to integrate Single-SPA with Module Federation.

### 2. Individual routing for each micro frontend

Another approach is to allow each micro frontend to handle its own routing. In this strategy, each micro frontend is responsible for defining its own routes and managing the navigation within its scope. The host application then acts as a coordinator, loading the appropriate micro frontend based on the user's navigation.

This approach provides more flexibility and autonomy to each micro frontend, allowing them to have their own routing logic. However, it requires careful coordination and communication between the micro frontends to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored different routing strategies that can be used with JavaScript Module Federation and Webpack 5. Both Single-SPA and individual routing for each micro frontend have their own advantages and considerations. The choice of routing strategy depends on the specific requirements and complexity of your application.

Regardless of the routing strategy you choose, JavaScript Module Federation enables you to build scalable and modular web applications by sharing and loading modules dynamically. With the power of Webpack 5, you can create a highly flexible and efficient architecture for your micro frontends.
