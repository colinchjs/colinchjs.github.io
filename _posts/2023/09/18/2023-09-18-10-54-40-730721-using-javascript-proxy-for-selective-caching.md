Caching is an essential technique in web development to improve the performance and reduce the load on the server. Traditionally, caching is implemented by storing the entire response or data in memory or disk. However, sometimes it is not efficient to cache every request or data. In such cases, selective caching becomes crucial. In this article, we will explore how we can use JavaScript Proxy to implement selective caching.

## What is JavaScript Proxy?

JavaScript Proxy is an advanced feature introduced in ES6. It allows you to intercept and customize fundamental operations (like property access, function invocation, etc.) on objects. Proxy objects enable you to define custom behavior when interacting with the target object without modifying its original implementation.

## Implementing Selective Caching using Proxy

To implement selective caching using Proxy, we can create a caching layer that intercepts object property access. Here's an example:

```javascript
const cache = new Map();

// Create a caching proxy
const cachingProxy = new Proxy(targetObject, {
  get: function(target, property) {
    if (!cache.has(property)) {
      // If the property is not cached, fetch the value and store it in the cache
      cache.set(property, target[property]);
    }
    
    // Return the cached value
    return cache.get(property);
  }
});

// Usage
console.log(cachingProxy.foo); // Accesses foo property and caches the value
console.log(cachingProxy.foo); // Returns the cached value
```

In the above example, we create a `cache` object using a `Map` to store the cached values. Then, we define a `cachingProxy` using `Proxy`. The `get` trap intercepts property access on the `targetObject`. If the property is not present in the cache, it fetches the value from the `targetObject` and stores it in the cache. Subsequent accesses to the same property return the cached value.

## Benefits of Selective Caching using Proxy

1. **Efficient Caching**: Selective caching allows you to cache only the required data, reducing memory usage and improving performance.
2. **Dynamic Caching**: Proxy provides a flexible way to define caching behavior. You can customize caching logic based on specific criteria or conditions.
3. **Transparent Integration**: The caching logic is encapsulated in the Proxy, ensuring that the rest of the application remains unaware of the caching implementation.

## Conclusion

JavaScript Proxy provides a powerful mechanism to implement selective caching by intercepting object property access. By caching only the required data, we can improve the performance of our applications. With the flexibility provided by Proxy, you can customize the caching behavior based on specific requirements. Selective caching not only optimizes performance but also reduces unnecessary network requests and server load. Implementing caching efficiently is crucial for delivering fast and responsive web applications.
