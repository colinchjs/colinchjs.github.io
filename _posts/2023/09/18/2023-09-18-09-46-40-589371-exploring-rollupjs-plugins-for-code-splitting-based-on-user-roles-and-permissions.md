In modern web applications, it is often necessary to divide the application code into smaller chunks in order to improve performance and optimize loading times. One common approach is code splitting, which allows us to load only the necessary code based on the user's role and permissions.

Rollup.js is a powerful bundler that enables us to create highly optimized JavaScript bundles for the web. It offers a flexible plugin system that allows us to extend its functionality. In this blog post, we will explore some Rollup.js plugins that can help us achieve code splitting based on user roles and permissions.

## 1. **@rollup/plugin-split**

The `@rollup/plugin-split` plugin is a powerful tool that splits the code into multiple chunks based on specified conditions. To achieve code splitting based on user roles and permissions, we can use this plugin in combination with some custom logic.

First, we need to identify the user's role and permissions. Depending on the user's role, we can create separate entry points for each role.

```javascript
// rollup.config.js

import { split } from '@rollup/plugin-split';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // Split code based on user role
    split({
      // Specify custom conditions
      test: (code, { moduleId }) => {
        // Define conditions for each role
        if (moduleId === 'admin') {
          // Split code for admin role
          return true;
        }
        // Split code for other roles
        return false;
      },
      // Specify output file names
      output: [
        {
          chunkFileNames: 'admin.[hash].js',
        },
        {
          chunkFileNames: '[hash].js',
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
};
```

By using this plugin, Rollup.js will split the code into separate chunks based on the conditions provided. In this example, the code for the admin role will be split into a separate chunk with the name "admin.[hash].js", while the code for other roles will be split into chunks with names "[hash].js".

## 2. **rollup-plugin-permissions**

The `rollup-plugin-permissions` plugin is specifically designed to handle code splitting based on user permissions. It allows us to define permissions for different parts of our code and split the code accordingly.

First, we need to define the permissions for different parts of our code in a separate configuration file.

```javascript
// permissions.config.js

export default {
  admin: ['manageUsers', 'manageProducts'],
  editor: ['editContent', 'publishContent'],
  viewer: ['viewContent'],
};
```

Next, we can use the `rollup-plugin-permissions` plugin in our Rollup.js configuration file to split the code based on these permissions.

```javascript
// rollup.config.js

import permissions from './permissions.config.js';
import { permissionsPlugin } from 'rollup-plugin-permissions';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // Split code based on user permissions
    permissionsPlugin({
      permissions,
    }),
  ],
};
```

By utilizing this plugin, Rollup.js will split the code into separate chunks based on the specified permissions. Each chunk will contain the code associated with the granted permissions.

## **Conclusion**

Rollup.js provides us with powerful plugins that enable code splitting based on user roles and permissions. By leveraging these plugins, we can optimize our application's loading times and improve overall performance. This approach allows us to load only the necessary code for each user, resulting in a better user experience.

With the `@rollup/plugin-split` and `rollup-plugin-permissions`, we can take control of code splitting in our web applications based on user roles and permissions. By using these plugins in combination with custom logic, we can achieve fine-grained code splitting tailored to our specific needs.
