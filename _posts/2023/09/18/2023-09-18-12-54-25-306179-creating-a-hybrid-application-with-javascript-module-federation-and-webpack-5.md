In today's tech landscape, hybrid applications are gaining popularity due to their ability to combine the best of both worlds - web and mobile development. JavaScript Module Federation and Webpack 5 are powerful tools that enable developers to build scalable and flexible hybrid applications. In this article, we will explore how to create a hybrid application using these technologies.

## What is JavaScript Module Federation?

JavaScript Module Federation is a feature that allows you to dynamically load and share JavaScript modules across multiple applications. It enables you to create micro-frontends, where each part of the application is developed independently and can be deployed and updated separately. This approach provides better maintainability, scalability, and modularity for your hybrid application.

## Why use Webpack 5?

Webpack 5 is a widely-used module bundler that helps manage dependencies and optimize JavaScript applications. With its new features and enhancements, Webpack 5 provides excellent support for JavaScript Module Federation. It allows you to create and configure hybrid applications with ease, making it an ideal choice for building hybrid applications.

## Getting Started

To create a hybrid application, follow these steps:

1. Install Webpack 5 globally:

```
npm install -g webpack@5
```

2. Set up a new project:

```
mkdir hybrid-app
cd hybrid-app
npm init -y
```

3. Install Webpack and its necessary loaders:

```
npm install webpack@5 webpack-cli@4 webpack-dev-server@3 html-webpack-plugin@5
```

4. Create a basic project structure:

```
mkdir src
touch src/index.js
touch src/index.html
```

5. Open `src/index.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue';

// Your application code goes here
```

6. Open `src/index.html` and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Hybrid App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

7. Create a `webpack.config.js` file in the root of the project and add the following code:

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
   filename: 'main.js',
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html',
    }),
  ],
};
```

8. Build and run the hybrid application:

```
npx webpack serve --mode development
```

## Conclusion

By combining JavaScript Module Federation and Webpack 5, you can create powerful hybrid applications that provide the best user experience across web and mobile platforms. This approach allows you to leverage the benefits of both worlds and build scalable and maintainable applications. Give it a try and see how it can enhance your development process.
