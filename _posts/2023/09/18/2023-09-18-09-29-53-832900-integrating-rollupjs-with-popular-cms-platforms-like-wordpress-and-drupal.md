CMS platforms like WordPress and Drupal are widely used for building robust and feature-rich websites. These platforms provide a wide range of functionalities and customizability options. However, when it comes to bundling and managing JavaScript modules, they might not offer the most optimized solutions.

This is where Rollup.js comes into play. Rollup.js is a popular module bundler for JavaScript that helps compile, bundle, and optimize your code for better performance. Integrating Rollup.js with CMS platforms like WordPress and Drupal can greatly enhance your development workflow and improve the loading speed of your website.

Benefits of using Rollup.js with CMS platforms:

1. **Improved performance**: Rollup.js utilizes tree-shaking and code splitting techniques to eliminate dead code and optimize the bundle size. This results in faster load times and improved performance for your website.

2. **Efficient code organization**: Rollup.js allows you to write modular code and import/export JavaScript modules easily. This makes your codebase more maintainable and encourages code reuse, leading to a more efficient development process.

Integrating Rollup.js with WordPress:

To integrate Rollup.js with WordPress, you can follow these steps:

1. First, install Rollup.js in your WordPress theme or plugin directory using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev rollup
   ```

2. Next, create a `rollup.config.js` file in your theme or plugin directory. This file will contain the configuration for Rollup.js:

   ```javascript
   import { nodeResolve } from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
   import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs';

   export default {
     input: 'src/index.js',
     output: {
       file: 'dist/bundle.js',
       format: 'iife',
     },
     plugins: [
       nodeResolve(),
       commonjs(),
     ],
   };
   ```

   In this example, we are using the `@rollup/plugin-node-resolve` and `@rollup/plugin-commonjs` plugins to resolve and bundle external dependencies.

3. Create a `src` directory in your theme or plugin directory and add your JavaScript files to it. For example, create an `index.js` file:

   ```javascript
   import { hello } from './utils';

   hello();
   ```

4. Finally, you can use Rollup.js to bundle your code by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx rollup -c
   ```

   This will create a `bundle.js` file in the `dist` directory, which you can then enqueue in your WordPress theme or plugin.

Integrating Rollup.js with Drupal:

To integrate Rollup.js with Drupal, you can follow these steps:

1. First, install Rollup.js in your Drupal project using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev rollup
   ```

2. Next, create a `rollup.config.js` file in your theme directory. This file will contain the configuration for Rollup.js:

   ```javascript
   import { nodeResolve } from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
   import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs';

   export default {
     input: 'src/index.js',
     output: {
       file: 'dist/bundle.js',
       format: 'iife',
     },
     plugins: [
       nodeResolve(),
       commonjs(),
     ],
   };
   ```

3. Create a `src` directory in your theme directory and add your JavaScript files to it. For example, create an `index.js` file:

   ```javascript
   import { hello } from './utils';

   hello();
   ```

4. Finally, you can use Rollup.js to bundle your code by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx rollup -c
   ```

   This will create a `bundle.js` file in the `dist` directory, which you can then include in your Drupal theme using the `drupal_add_js` function.

Conclusion:

Integrating Rollup.js with popular CMS platforms like WordPress and Drupal can greatly enhance your development workflow and improve the performance of your website. With Rollup.js, you can organize and bundle your JavaScript code more efficiently, resulting in faster load times and better user experience.
