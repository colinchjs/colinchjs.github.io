In modern web applications, it is common to make multiple asynchronous HTTP requests. However, these requests can sometimes result in redundant calls to the server, leading to unnecessary network traffic and slower performance. One way to optimize this is by implementing request deduplication, where subsequent requests for the same resource are combined or discarded.

In this article, we will explore how to implement request deduplication using a JavaScript Proxy. The Proxy object allows us to intercept and customize operations performed on objects, including function calls. We can leverage this functionality to intercept and merge duplicate requests.

## The Proxy Object in JavaScript

The Proxy object in JavaScript allows us to define custom behavior on objects. We can create a Proxy object around another object, and intercept operations such as property access, method calls, and more.

To create a Proxy, we need to define a target object and a handler object. The handler object contains traps, which are methods that define the behavior when certain operations are performed on the Proxy.

## Implementing Request Deduplication

To implement request deduplication, we can create a Proxy around our HTTP request function. Whenever a request is made, we check if there is a pending request for the same resource. If there is, we can return the existing promise instead of creating a new request. This can be achieved by keeping track of the pending requests in a cache object.

Here's an example implementation:

```javascript
const requestCache = {};

const requestData = async (url) => {
  if (requestCache[url]) {
    return requestCache[url];
  }

  const requestPromise = fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .finally(() => {
      delete requestCache[url];
    });

  requestCache[url] = requestPromise;
  return requestPromise;
};

const proxiedRequestData = new Proxy(requestData, {
  apply(target, thisArg, args) {
    const [url] = args;
    return target(url);
  }
});
```

In the above code, we create a `requestCache` object to store pending requests. The `requestData` function checks if a request for the same `url` is already in progress. If it is, we return the existing promise. Otherwise, we create a new request using `fetch` and store the promise in the cache object. Finally, we delete the entry from the cache when the request is completed, whether it successfully resolves or rejects.

We then create a Proxy object `proxiedRequestData` around `requestData`, intercepting function calls using the `apply` trap. This allows us to seamlessly replace the original function with our proxied function.

## Conclusion

Implementing proxy-based request deduplication in JavaScript can significantly improve performance and reduce network traffic in web applications. By leveraging the Proxy object, we can intercept and merge duplicate HTTP requests, resulting in faster load times and a better user experience.

If you want to boost the performance of your web application, consider implementing request deduplication using a JavaScript Proxy. Your users will appreciate the noticeable improvement in speed and responsiveness.
