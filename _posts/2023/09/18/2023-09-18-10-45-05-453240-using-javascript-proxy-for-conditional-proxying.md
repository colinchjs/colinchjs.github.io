JavaScript Proxy is a powerful feature that allows us to intercept and customize object operations. It provides a way to define custom behavior for fundamental operations like getting or setting properties, invoking functions, and more. One interesting use case of Proxy is conditional proxying, where we can dynamically decide whether to proxy an object or pass through the operations directly.

## What is Conditional Proxying?

Conditional proxying refers to the concept of selectively intercepting object operations based on certain conditions. Instead of intercepting and customizing all operations, we can use Proxy to intercept only when a specific condition is met. This allows us to have fine-grained control over the proxy behavior.

## Implementing Conditional Proxying with JavaScript Proxy

To implement conditional proxying, we need to define a handler object that contains the trapping methods for various operations that we want to intercept. In these trapping methods, we can check the condition and decide whether to proxy the operation or pass it through.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use Proxy for conditional proxying:

```javascript
const target = {
  foo: 'bar',
};

const handler = {
  get: function (target, property, receiver) {
    if (property === 'foo') {
      // Proxy the get operation
      console.log('Proxying get operation');
      return `Proxy - ${target[property]}`;
    }
    // Pass through the get operation
    return target[property];
  },

  set: function (target, property, value, receiver) {
    if (property === 'foo') {
      // Proxy the set operation
      console.log('Proxying set operation');
      target[property] = `Proxy - ${value}`;
    } else {
      // Pass through the set operation
      target[property] = value;
    }
    return true;
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);

// Accessing the property 'foo'
console.log(proxy.foo); // 'Proxy - bar'

// Setting the property 'foo'
proxy.foo = 'baz';
console.log(proxy.foo); // 'Proxy - baz'
```

In this example, we have defined a target object with a property named `foo`. The handler object contains trapping methods for `get` and `set` operations. Within these trapping methods, we check if the property is `'foo'`, and if so, we proxy the operation by adding a prefix `'Proxy - '` to the value.

By using conditional proxying, we can selectively intercept and customize object operations, providing a flexible way to implement dynamic behavior based on specific conditions.

## Conclusion

JavaScript Proxy is a versatile feature that allows us to intercept and customize object operations. By utilizing conditional proxying, we can selectively intercept and modify operations based on specific conditions, providing fine-grained control over the proxy behavior. This opens up possibilities for implementing dynamic behaviors and advanced customization in JavaScript applications.
