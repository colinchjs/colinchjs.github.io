In modern web development, it's common to use different tools for different parts of the build process. While Rollup.js is a powerful bundler for JavaScript modules, task runners like Grunt and Gulp provide a wide range of automation capabilities. In this article, we'll explore how to integrate Rollup.js with task runners to create a mixed build workflow that leverages the strengths of both.

## Why use Rollup.js with Task Runners

Rollup.js is known for its tree-shaking capabilities, which eliminate dead code and optimize the final bundle size. Additionally, it provides support for modern JavaScript features such as modules and dynamic imports. On the other hand, task runners like Grunt and Gulp offer a rich ecosystem of plugins and tasks for automating repetitive build tasks, such as transpiling, minifying, and optimizing assets.

By combining Rollup.js with task runners, we can harness the power of Rollup.js for module bundling and tree-shaking while leveraging the automation capabilities of the task runners to handle other build tasks. This allows for a seamless integration of Rollup.js into existing build workflows without sacrificing the flexibility and extensibility provided by task runners.

## Integrating Rollup.js with Grunt

To integrate Rollup.js with Grunt, we'll need to install the necessary npm packages:

```
npm install grunt grunt-rollup rollup-plugin-commonjs rollup-plugin-node-resolve --save-dev
```

Next, we'll create a Gruntfile.js and configure the Grunt tasks for Rollup.js. Here's an example configuration that uses Rollup.js to bundle a JavaScript module:

```javascript
module.exports = function(grunt) {
  grunt.initConfig({
    rollup: {
      options: {
        format: 'iife',
        plugins: [
          require('rollup-plugin-node-resolve')(),
          require('rollup-plugin-commonjs')()
        ]
      },
      main: {
        files: {
          'dist/bundle.js': ['src/main.js']
        }
      }
    }
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-rollup');
  grunt.registerTask('default', ['rollup']);
};
```

In this example, the `rollup` task is configured with options for the desired output format (`iife`) and the required plugins (`rollup-plugin-node-resolve` and `rollup-plugin-commonjs`). The `main` target specifies the input file (`src/main.js`) and the output file (`dist/bundle.js`).

To run the Rollup.js bundling task with Grunt, simply execute the `grunt` command in the terminal.

## Integrating Rollup.js with Gulp

To integrate Rollup.js with Gulp, we'll need to install the necessary npm packages:

```
npm install gulp gulp-rollup rollup-plugin-commonjs rollup-plugin-node-resolve --save-dev
```

Next, we'll create a gulpfile.js and configure the Gulp tasks for Rollup.js. Here's an example configuration that uses Rollup.js to bundle a JavaScript module:

```javascript
const gulp = require('gulp');
const rollup = require('gulp-rollup');
const commonjs = require('rollup-plugin-commonjs');
const resolve = require('rollup-plugin-node-resolve');

gulp.task('rollup', () => {
  return gulp.src('src/main.js')
    .pipe(rollup({
      plugins: [
        resolve(),
        commonjs()
      ]
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});

gulp.task('default', gulp.series('rollup'));
```

In this example, the `rollup` task is configured with the necessary plugins (`rollup-plugin-commonjs` and `rollup-plugin-node-resolve`). The source file (`src/main.js`) is piped through the Rollup.js bundling process and the resulting bundle is saved in the `dist` directory.

To run the Rollup.js bundling task with Gulp, simply execute the `gulp` command in the terminal.

## Conclusion

Integrating Rollup.js with task runners like Grunt and Gulp allows for a mixed build workflow that combines the power of Rollup.js for module bundling and tree-shaking with the automation capabilities of the task runners. This enables developers to create optimized and efficient builds while benefiting from the extensibility and flexibility provided by task runners.

By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily integrate Rollup.js with task runners in your own build process, resulting in a streamlined and efficient workflow. Start using Rollup.js with your favorite task runner today to take advantage of its bundling capabilities and boost your development productivity.
