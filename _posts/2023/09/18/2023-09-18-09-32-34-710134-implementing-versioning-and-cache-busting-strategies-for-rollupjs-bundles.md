## Versioning Strategies

Implementing a versioning strategy is essential to manage updates and ensure that users receive the latest version of your bundles. Here are a few common versioning strategies for Rollup.js bundles:

1. **Manual Versioning**: In this approach, you manually update the version number in your bundle file names each time you make changes. For example, `bundle-v1.js`, `bundle-v2.js`, and so on. This method can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for larger projects, but it offers full control over versioning.

2. **Timestamp Versioning**: Instead of manually updating the version number, you can append a timestamp to your bundle file names. For example, `bundle-1626394869372.js`. This method ensures that each time you build your bundles, a new timestamp is added, which effectively invalidates the cache.

3. **Semantic Versioning**: If you're following semantic versioning for your project, you can include the version number directly in the bundle file names. For example, `bundle-1.0.0.js`, `bundle-1.1.0.js`, and so on. This approach provides a clear indication of the bundle's version and allows you to manage updates systematically.

## Cache Busting Strategies

Cache busting techniques are used to force browsers to fetch the latest version of a file, rather than relying on previously cached versions. Here are some cache busting strategies you can apply to your Rollup.js bundles:

1. **Query String**: By adding a query parameter with a unique value to the bundle file URL, you can effectively bust the cache. For example, `bundle.js?v=12345`. Whenever you make changes to your bundle, update the query parameter value to invalidate the cache.

2. **File Hashing**: To ensure that browsers fetch the latest version of your bundles, you can generate a unique hash based on the bundle's content and include it in the file name. For example, `bundle-9583c90bf.js`. This method guarantees that any changes to the bundle content will result in a different filename, thus preventing caching issues.

Now that you have an understanding of versioning and cache busting strategies, you can choose the approach that best fits your project's requirements. Incorporating these strategies into your Rollup.js workflow will help ensure a smooth and reliable deployment process, providing users with the most up-to-date version of your bundles.
