When developing a library in TypeScript, it is essential to generate declaration files (.d.ts) to provide type information to consumers of the library. These declaration files allow users to benefit from static type checking and auto-completion when using the library in their projects.

Rollup.js is a popular bundler primarily used for JavaScript libraries. However, it can also be leveraged to generate TypeScript declaration files along with the bundled JavaScript code.

## Why use Rollup.js for generating declaration files?

1. **Efficient bundling:** Rollup.js is known for its tree-shaking capabilities, which optimize the bundle size by removing unused code. By using Rollup.js for declaration file generation, we can minimize the size of the generated declaration files.

2. **Compatible with TypeScript:** Rollup.js seamlessly integrates with TypeScript and allows you to bundle TypeScript code with proper type checking. This ensures the generated declaration files accurately reflect the types used in the library.

## Setting up Rollup.js for declaration file generation

To leverage Rollup.js for generating declaration files in a library project, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Install necessary dependencies**: Start by installing Rollup.js and other required plugins using npm or yarn.

```typescript
npm install rollup typescript @rollup/plugin-typescript --save-dev
```

2. **Create Rollup configuration file**: Create a `rollup.config.js` file at the root of the project. This file will specify the input file, output directory, and other Rollup plugins to use.

```javascript
import typescript from '@rollup/plugin-typescript';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.ts',
  output: [
    {
      dir: 'dist',
      format: 'es',
    },
  ],
  plugins: [typescript()],
  // ... Other Rollup configuration
};
```

3. **Configure TypeScript**: In your `tsconfig.json` file, make sure to set `"declaration": true` and `"declarationDir": "dist/types"` to enable declaration file generation and define the output directory.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationDir": "dist/types",
    // ... Other TypeScript configuration
  },
  // ... Other configuration
}
```

4. **Add build script**: Update your `package.json` to include a build script that runs Rollup.js.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup --config",
    // ... Other scripts
  },
  // ... Other configuration
}
```

## Generating declaration files

Once the setup is complete, run the build script to generate your library bundle and declaration files.

```bash
npm run build
```

Rollup.js will transpile your TypeScript code, bundle it, and generate the required declaration files in the specified output directory.

## Conclusion

Using Rollup.js for generating TypeScript declaration files for your library project provides several benefits, including efficient bundling and seamless integration with TypeScript. By following the setup steps and leveraging Rollup.js's capabilities, you can ensure that your library provides accurate type information to users, enhancing their development experience.
