Continuous Integration (CI) is an essential part of modern software development workflows. It helps streamline code integration, detect issues early on, and deliver high-quality software. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate Rollup.js, a popular JavaScript module bundler, with two popular CI platforms - Jenkins and Travis CI.

## Why use Rollup.js?

Rollup.js is a powerful module bundler that follows the ES module format. Its ability to create optimized bundles for web applications makes it a popular choice among developers. With Rollup.js, you can easily bundle your JavaScript modules while leveraging features like tree-shaking and code splitting.

## Integrate Rollup.js with Jenkins

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is a widely-used open-source automation server that supports CI/CD. To integrate Rollup.js with Jenkins, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Rollup.js is installed globally on your Jenkins agent machine.
2. Create a Jenkins pipeline script that invokes the Rollup.js CLI to bundle your application.
3. Configure the pipeline to trigger on changes to your source code repository.
4. Configure the pipeline to run the Rollup.js CLI command.
5. Optionally, configure the pipeline to deploy the bundled assets to your desired location.

## Integrate Rollup.js with Travis CI

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) is another popular CI platform that offers cloud-based build and test automation services. To integrate Rollup.js with Travis CI, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Rollup.js is listed as a dev dependency in your project's `package.json` file.
2. Create a `.travis.yml` file in the root of your project.
3. Configure the `.travis.yml` file to use the appropriate Node.js version.
4. Add a `before_script` section to install dependencies.
5. Add a `script` section that runs the Rollup.js CLI command to bundle your application.
6. Optionally, add additional steps in the `script` section to execute tests or deploy the bundled assets.

Remember to configure the necessary environment variables or authentication tokens for deployment, if required.

## Conclusion

Integrating Rollup.js with CI platforms like Jenkins and Travis CI can greatly benefit your development process. It allows you to automate the creation of optimized bundles for your JavaScript modules, ensuring faster loading times and better overall performance. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can seamlessly incorporate Rollup.js into your CI workflows and enjoy the benefits it offers.
