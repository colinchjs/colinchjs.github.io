To achieve cross-browser compatibility, it is crucial to handle any missing or unsupported features in older browsers. This is where polyfills come into play. Polyfills are code snippets or scripts that provide the missing functionality in browsers that do not support certain features.

When using Rollup.js, you have the option to include polyfills directly in your bundle. This can be achieved using the `@rollup/plugin-node-polyfills` plugin. This plugin includes polyfills for Node.js-specific features and environment-specific functionality, such as `process` or `fs`. Including necessary polyfills can help ensure that your code runs smoothly across different environments.

To add the `@rollup/plugin-node-polyfills` to your Rollup.js configuration, follow these steps:

1. Install the plugin by running the following command in your project's root directory:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @rollup/plugin-node-polyfills
   ```

2. Once installed, import the plugin in your `rollup.config.js` file:

   ```javascript
   import { nodePolyfills } from '@rollup/plugin-node-polyfills';
   ```

3. In the `plugins` section of your configuration, include the `nodePolyfills` plugin:

   ```javascript
   export default {
     // ...other options
     plugins: [
       nodePolyfills(),
       // ...other plugins
     ],
   };
   ```

By including the `nodePolyfills` plugin, Rollup.js will automatically detect the features used in your code and include the appropriate polyfills in the final bundle. This ensures that your application functions correctly in older browsers that lack support for certain features.

Remember to always test your application in different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility. Including the necessary polyfills using Rollup.js significantly simplifies the process by automating the addition of required functionality.
