JavaScript Proxy is a powerful feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allows you to intercept and customize operations performed on objects. It enables you to create a "proxy" object that wraps the target object and intercepts various operations such as property access, assignment, function invocation, and more.

Using a Proxy, you can add custom logic to handle these operations, making it immensely useful for implementing features like data validation, logging, caching, and security controls. Let's explore how to apply object interception using JavaScript Proxy.

## Creating a Proxy

To create a Proxy object, we use the `Proxy` constructor and pass in two arguments: the target object and a handler object. The handler object contains the traps (methods) that will be invoked when a corresponding operation is performed on the proxy.

Here's an example:

```javascript
const target = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const handler = {
  get(target, property) {
    console.log(`Getting property: ${property}`);
    return target[property];
  },
  set(target, property, value) {
    console.log(`Setting property: ${property} to ${value}`);
    target[property] = value;
  },
};
const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);

console.log(proxy.name); // Logs: Getting property: name
proxy.age = 35; // Logs: Setting property: age to 35
console.log(proxy.age); // Logs: Getting property: age, 35
```

In this example, we create a Proxy object `proxy` using `target` object and `handler`. The `get` trap intercepts property access and logs a message before returning the corresponding value from the target object. The `set` trap intercepts property assignment, logs a message, and updates the target object accordingly.

## Common Traps

The handler object can define various traps to intercept different operations. Some commonly used traps include:

- `get`: Intercepts property access on the proxy object.
- `set`: Intercepts property assignment on the proxy object.
- `apply`: Intercepts function invocation on the proxy object.
- `deleteProperty`: Intercepts property deletion on the proxy object.
- `has`: Intercepts the `in` operator to check if a property exists on the proxy object.
- `construct`: Intercepts object instantiation with the `new` keyword.

You can find the complete list of traps in the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy#handler_functions).

## Use Cases

JavaScript Proxy is a versatile feature that can be applied to various use cases. Here are a few examples:

### Data Validation

You can use a Proxy to enforce data validation rules, ensuring that only valid data is stored in an object. By intercepting the `set` trap, you can validate the incoming values before updating the target object.

### Caching

Proxies can be used to implement caching mechanisms by intercepting expensive function invocations. You can cache the result of a function call and return it directly if the same input is provided again.

### Logging

Using a Proxy, you can log every access, assignment, and function invocation made on an object. This can be helpful for debugging and tracking changes in complex applications.

### Security Controls

Proxies can be a powerful tool for implementing security controls by intercepting operations that violate your access or authorization rules. For example, you can restrict access to certain properties or prevent the deletion of critical properties.

## Conclusion

JavaScript Proxy provides a flexible way to intercept and customize operations performed on objects. It enables you to add custom logic for handling properties, functions, and object instantiation. By using Proxy, you can implement features like data validation, caching, logging, and security controls effectively. Experiment with this feature to enhance the capabilities of your JavaScript applications.
