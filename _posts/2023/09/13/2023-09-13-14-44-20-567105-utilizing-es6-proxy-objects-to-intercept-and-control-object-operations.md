ES6 Proxy Objects are a powerful feature in JavaScript that allow us to intercept and control object operations. They provide a way to create a "proxy" around an object, allowing us to modify the default behavior of that object.

## Why Use Proxy Objects?

Proxy objects give us the ability to manipulate and customize the behavior of objects, making them extremely useful in scenarios where we need to add extra functionality or validation to object operations.

## Creating a Proxy Object

To create a proxy object, we use the `new Proxy()` constructor. Here's an example of creating a simple proxy object that intercepts property access and logs a message:

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 25
};

const handler = {
  get(target, prop) {
    console.log(`Accessing property: ${prop}`);
    return target[prop];
  }
};

const proxy = new Proxy(obj, handler);

console.log(proxy.name); // Accessing property: name, John
console.log(proxy.age); // Accessing property: age, 25
```

In the above example, the `handler` object contains a `get()` method that intercepts property access and logs the property name before returning the value from the original object.

## Controlling Object Operations

Proxy objects allow us to control various object operations such as property access, setting property values, deleting properties, and more. The `handler` object can be extended to include different methods to intercept these operations.

Here's an example of controlling the object's property assignment:

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
};

const handler = {
  set(target, prop, value) {
    if (prop === 'name') {
      console.log('Name cannot be changed');
      return false;
    }
    target[prop] = value;
    return true;
  }
};

const proxy = new Proxy(obj, handler);

proxy.name = 'Jane'; // Name cannot be changed
```

In this example, the `set()` method intercepts the assignment of the `name` property and prevents its change by returning `false`.

## Conclusion

ES6 Proxy Objects give us the ability to intercept and control object operations, providing a flexible way to customize and add extra functionality to JavaScript objects. By utilizing Proxy Objects, we can create powerful and customizable code that meets our specific requirements.
