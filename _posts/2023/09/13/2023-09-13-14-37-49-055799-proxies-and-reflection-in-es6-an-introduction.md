## Introduction

Ever wondered how to dynamically intercept and customize object behavior in JavaScript? Enter **proxies** and **reflection** in ES6! These powerful features allow you to create **proxy objects** that wrap around real objects and provide a **layer of indirection**. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of proxies and reflection, understand their use cases, and provide some examples of how to leverage them in your code.

## Proxies

A proxy is an object that wraps around another object and **intercepts** its fundamental operations. By using a proxy, you can add custom logic before or after an object's property is accessed, modified, or deleted. This gives you fine-grained control over the behavior of your objects.

To create a proxy object, we use the `Proxy` constructor and pass in two arguments: the target object, and a **handler** object that contains the methods to intercept the object operations. Let's look at an example below:

```javascript
const target = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
};

const handler = {
  get: function(target, property) {
    console.log(`Getting value of property "${property}"`);
    return target[property];
  },

  set: function(target, property, value) {
    console.log(`Setting value of property "${property}"`);
    target[property] = value;
  },
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);

console.log(proxy.name);  // Output: Getting value of property "name", John
proxy.age = 30; // Output: Setting value of property "age"

console.log(target.age); // Output: 30
```

In the example above, the `handler` object intercepts the `get` and `set` operations of the `target` object. Whenever a property is accessed or modified, the corresponding methods of the `handler` are invoked.

## Reflection

Reflection allows you to inspect and manipulate objects at runtime. ES6 provides a built-in `Reflect` API that offers a set of methods to perform common reflection tasks.

With reflection, you can perform operations like checking if a property exists, getting and setting property values, invoking methods dynamically, and much more. Reflection is especially useful when working with proxy objects.

```javascript
const target = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
};

console.log(Reflect.has(target, "name")); // Output: true

Reflect.set(target, "age", 30);

console.log(Reflect.get(target, "age")); // Output: 30
```

In the example above, we use the `Reflect` API to check if the `name` property exists and to get and set the value of the `age` property.

## Conclusion

Proxies and reflection in ES6 provide powerful tools to customize object behavior and perform runtime inspection and manipulation. By leveraging proxies, you can intercept object operations and add custom logic. Reflection allows you to dynamically interact with objects and perform common tasks. These features open up a world of possibilities for creating dynamic and flexible JavaScript applications.

So, next time you find yourself in a situation where you need fine-grained control over object behavior or the ability to introspect and manipulate objects at runtime, proxies and reflection in ES6 are there to save the day!
