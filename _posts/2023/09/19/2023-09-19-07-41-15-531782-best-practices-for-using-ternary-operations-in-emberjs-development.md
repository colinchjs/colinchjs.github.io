## Understanding Ternary Operations

In JavaScript, a ternary operation is a shortcut for an `if-else` statement. It consists of a condition, followed by a `?` symbol, and two expressions separated by a `:` symbol. If the condition is true, the first expression is executed. Otherwise, the second expression is executed.

Here's the basic syntax of a ternary operation:

```javascript
const result = condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

## Using Ternary Operations in Ember.js

1. **Keep it simple**: Ternary operations are great for handling simple conditions and returning values based on those conditions. Avoid nesting multiple ternary operations or using complex expressions within a single ternary operation. This helps in maintaining code readability and prevents potential bugs.

2. **Use with caution**: While ternary operations can make code more concise, they can also make it harder to understand. Before using a ternary operation, consider if it improves code readability. If it doesn't, consider using traditional `if-else` statements instead.

3. **Assigning values**: Ternary operations are useful for assigning values to variables based on conditions. For instance, you can use a ternary operation to conditionally assign a value to a variable, as shown in the following example:

```javascript
const message = isLoggedIn ? 'Welcome back!' : 'Please log in';
```

4. **Rendering templates**: In Ember.js, you can utilize ternary operations to conditionally render templates. For example, you can use a ternary operation in a handlebars template to display different content based on a condition. Here's an example:

```hbs
{{#if isUserLoggedIn}}
  <p>Welcome back!</p>
{{else}}
  <p>Please log in</p>
{{/if}}
```

5. **Handling computed properties**: Ternary operations are useful when working with computed properties in Ember.js. You can use a ternary operation to define a computed property that depends on other properties or conditions. For instance, consider the following example:

```javascript
isUserLoggedIn: computed('username', function() {
  return this.get('username') ? true : false;
})
```

In this example, the `isUserLoggedIn` computed property returns true if the `username` property has a value, and false otherwise.

## Conclusion

Ternary operations are a handy tool for writing concise and readable code in Ember.js. By following these best practices, you can effectively utilize ternary operations in your Ember.js development workflow. Remember to keep it simple, use them judiciously, and leverage them in handling values, rendering templates, and working with computed properties.
