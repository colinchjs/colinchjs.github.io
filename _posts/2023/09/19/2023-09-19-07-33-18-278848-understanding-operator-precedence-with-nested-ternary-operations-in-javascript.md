Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. In the context of nested ternary operations, it determines the order in which the conditions are evaluated and the corresponding values are returned.

Let's consider an example where we want to assign a value to a variable based on multiple conditions using nested ternary operators:

```javascript
let x = condition1 ? value1 : (condition2 ? value2 : value3);
```

In this example, we have two conditions: `condition1` and `condition2`. If `condition1` is true, `value1` is assigned to `x`. If `condition1` is false, then `condition2` is evaluated. If `condition2` is true, `value2` is assigned to `x`. Otherwise, `value3` is assigned to `x`.

To better understand the operator precedence here, let's break down the expression:

```javascript
let x = condition1 ? value1 : (
  condition2 ? value2 : value3
);
```

The nested parentheses indicate the order of evaluation. First, `condition1` is evaluated. If it is true, execution jumps to the `value1` and assigns it to `x`. If `condition1` is false, execution moves to the second part of the expression `(condition2 ? value2 : value3)`.

Within the nested part of the expression, `condition2` is evaluated. If it is true, `value2` is assigned to `x`. Otherwise, if `condition2` is false, `value3` is assigned to `x`.

It is crucial to understand the operator precedence in JavaScript to avoid unexpected results. If we don't include the parentheses around the nested ternary expression `(condition2 ? value2 : value3)`, the operator precedence could lead to unexpected behavior. The expression would then be evaluated as `condition1 ? value1 : condition2 ? value2 : value3`, which might not give the desired results.

In conclusion, understanding operator precedence is vital when working with nested ternary operations in JavaScript. Proper usage of parentheses ensures that conditions are evaluated in the correct order, allowing us to write clean and concise code while maintaining the expected behavior.
