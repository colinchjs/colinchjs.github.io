JavaScript provides several powerful tools for data manipulation, including the Ternary Operator. This operator allows you to write concise conditional statements in a single line of code. In this blog post, we will explore some examples of using ternary operators for data manipulation in JavaScript.

## Example 1: Conditional Assignment

One common use case for ternary operators is conditional assignment. Let's say we have a variable `isLogged` that represents whether a user is logged in or not. We want to assign a welcome message based on the value of `isLogged`. Here's how we can do it using a ternary operator:

```javascript
const message = isLogged ? "Welcome back!" : "Please log in!";
```

In this example, if `isLogged` is `true`, the value of `message` will be "Welcome back!". Otherwise, the value will be "Please log in!". This allows us to conditionally assign values based on a specific condition.

## Example 2: Conditional Execution

Another use case for ternary operators is conditional execution. Let's say we have a function `calculateDiscount()` that calculates the discount for a given purchase amount. If the purchase amount is greater than $100, we want to apply a 10% discount; otherwise, no discount should be applied. Here's how we can achieve this using a ternary operator:

```javascript
const discount = purchaseAmount > 100 ? 0.1 * purchaseAmount : 0;
```

In this example, if `purchaseAmount` is greater than 100, the value of `discount` will be 10% of `purchaseAmount`. Otherwise, the value will be 0, indicating no discount.

## Conclusion

Ternary operators are a powerful tool for data manipulation in JavaScript. They allow us to write concise conditional statements, making our code more readable and efficient. In this blog post, we explored two examples of using ternary operators for conditional assignment and execution. By leveraging ternary operators, we can write cleaner code and handle conditional logic more efficiently.
