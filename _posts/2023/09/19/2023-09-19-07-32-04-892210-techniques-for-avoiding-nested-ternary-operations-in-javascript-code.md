As developers, we often come across situations where we need to make decisions based on conditions. In JavaScript, one way to handle conditional logic is by using a ternary operator. While ternary operators are concise and can be useful in some cases, using nested ternary operations can quickly make code difficult to read and maintain. In this blog post, we will explore some techniques to avoid using nested ternary operations and write more structured and maintainable code.

## 1. Use if-else statements

Instead of using nested ternary operations, consider using `if-else` statements. These statements provide a more natural way to handle multiple conditions and can improve code readability. Here's an example:

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // code block for condition1
} else if (condition2) {
  // code block for condition2
} else if (condition3) {
  // code block for condition3
} else {
  // default code block
}
```

Using `if-else` statements allows for more flexibility and easier debugging. It also allows for the addition of new conditions in the future without affecting existing code.

## 2. Use switch statements

Another approach to handle complex conditions is by using `switch` statements. These statements allow you to perform different actions based on different values of an expression. Here's an example:

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code block for value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code block for value2
    break;
  case value3:
    // code block for value3
    break;
  default:
    // default code block
}
```

`switch` statements provide a clear structure to handle multiple conditions and are particularly useful when there are multiple options to check against. They are easier to read and understand compared to nested ternary operations.

## Conclusion

While ternary operators can be helpful in some scenarios, it's important to avoid nested ternary operations in JavaScript code. Instead, consider using `if-else` statements or `switch` statements to handle complex conditions and improve code readability. By following these techniques, you can write more maintainable code that is easier to understand, debug, and modify in the future.
