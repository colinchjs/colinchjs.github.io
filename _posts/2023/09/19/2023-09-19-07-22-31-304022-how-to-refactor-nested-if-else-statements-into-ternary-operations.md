If you find yourself dealing with nested if-else statements in your code, it can make the logic harder to follow and maintain. One way to simplify and condense nested if-else statements is to refactor them into ternary operations. 

Ternary operations are concise expressions that evaluate a condition and return a value based on the result of the condition. They have the following format:

```
condition ? value if true : value if false
```

To refactor nested if-else statements into ternary operations, follow these steps:

1. Identify the outer if-else condition.
2. Evaluate if it's possible to simplify the nested if-else logic into a ternary operation.
3. Determine the value or expression that the ternary operation should return for each branch of the if-else statement.
4. Replace the nested if-else statement with the ternary operation.

Here's an example to illustrate the process:

```java
if (x > 0) {
    if (y > 0) {
        result = "Both x and y are positive";
    } else {
        result = "x is positive, but y is not";
    }
} else {
    result = "x is not positive";
}
```

The above nested if-else statement can be refactored into a ternary operation:

```java
result = (x > 0) ? (y > 0 ? "Both x and y are positive" : "x is positive, but y is not") : "x is not positive";
```

In the refactored code, the ternary operation evaluates the condition `(x > 0)`. If it's true, it evaluates the nested ternary operation `(y > 0)`, returning the corresponding value based on the condition evaluation. If the outer condition is false, it returns the value `"x is not positive"`.

Refactoring nested if-else statements in this way can help make your code more concise and easier to understand. However, it's important to ensure that the resulting code remains readable and maintainable. It's recommended to use ternary operations sparingly and avoid overly complex expressions to maintain code readability.
