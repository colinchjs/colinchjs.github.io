Conditional rendering is a common practice in React Native when you want to show or hide certain components based on certain conditions. One way to achieve this is by using ternary operators, which allow you to conditionally render different components within your JSX code.

In React Native, JSX is used to write components in a syntax that resembles HTML. By utilizing ternary operators in JSX, you can easily determine which components should be rendered based on a given condition.

Here's an example of how ternary operators can be used for conditional rendering in React Native:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const ExampleComponent = ({ isLoggedIn }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      {isLoggedIn ? (
        <Text>Welcome back, user!</Text>
      ) : (
        <Text>Please login to continue.</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In the code above, the `isLoggedIn` prop is used to determine whether to render the "Welcome back, user!" message or the "Please login to continue." message. If the `isLoggedIn` prop is `true`, the first expression within the ternary operator is rendered, otherwise the second expression is rendered.

By using ternary operators, you can easily control what gets rendered on the screen based on the value of a condition. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with simple conditional logic in your React Native components.

Remember to make sure your condition is wrapped in parentheses when using ternary operators within JSX to ensure proper rendering.
