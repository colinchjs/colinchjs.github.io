Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) combine the best of both web and native app experiences, providing a seamless experience across devices. One important aspect of building PWAs is implementing secure authentication mechanisms, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT). In this blog post, we will explore how to handle JWT authentication in a server-side rendered PWA.

## What is JWT?

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact and self-contained mechanism for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header contains the algorithm used for signing the token, the payload includes the information to be transmitted, and the signature is used to verify the authenticity of the token.

## Setup

To handle JWT authentication in a server-side rendered PWA, you'll need to perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Implement JWT Authentication on the Server-side

In your server-side code, you need to generate and validate the JWT. You can use a JWT library for your programming language of choice. **For example, in Node.js**, you can use the `jsonwebtoken` library:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const secretKey = 'your-secret-key';

// Generate a JWT
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: '123' }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });

// Verify and decode a JWT
try {
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, secretKey);
  console.log(decoded.userId);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Invalid token');
}
```
Remember to store your secret key securely and use environment variables to protect sensitive information.

### Step 2: Implement Login and Registration Pages

In your PWA, create login and registration pages where users can provide their credentials. Upon successful authentication, the server sends back a JWT to the client, which should be securely stored.

### Step 3: Implement JWT Validation on Protected Routes

For any protected routes in your PWA, you need to validate the JWT sent in the request headers. On the server-side, use the same JWT library to verify and decode the token. Based on the decoded information, you can grant or deny access to protected routes.

## Conclusion

By handling JWT authentication in your server-side rendered PWA, you can ensure secure access to protected resources. The server generates and validates the JWT, while the client stores and sends the token with each request. This mechanism provides a seamless and secure experience for your users. Implementing JWT authentication requires careful consideration of security best practices and robust error handling.
