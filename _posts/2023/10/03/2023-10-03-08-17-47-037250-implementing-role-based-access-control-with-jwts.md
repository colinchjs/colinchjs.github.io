In a modern web application, security is of utmost importance. One way to secure your application and control access to its resources is through **Role-Based Access Control** (RBAC). RBAC allows you to assign specific roles to users and grant them access to different parts of your application based on those roles. 

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement RBAC using **JSON Web Tokens** (JWTs). JWTs are a popular method of securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. They are commonly used in web applications for authentication and authorization purposes.

## Why use JWTs for RBAC?

JWTs are a stateless way of authenticating and authorizing users. They contain all the necessary information within the token itself, eliminating the need for server-side session storage. This makes JWTs a great choice for implementing RBAC, as they provide a secure and scalable solution.

## Generating JWTs with Role Claims

To implement RBAC with JWTs, we need to include role claims in the tokens. Role claims are specific to a user's role and define what actions they can perform within the application.

Here's an example of a JWT payload with a "roles" claim:

```javascript
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "roles": ["admin", "user"],
  "exp": 1626750123
}
```

In the example above, the JWT contains two roles: "admin" and "user". These roles can be used to determine what resources and functionalities a user has access to.

## Verifying JWTs and Implementing RBAC

When a user makes a request to your application, you need to verify the JWT and extract the role claims from it. Once you have the role claims, you can use them to determine what actions the user is authorized to perform.

Here's an example of how you can verify a JWT and implement RBAC using Node.js and Express:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const secretKey = 'your-secret-key';

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  }

  try {
    const decodedToken = jwt.verify(token, secretKey);
    req.user = decodedToken;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
  }
});

app.get('/admin', (req, res) => {
  if (req.user.roles.includes('admin')) {
    // Authorized action for admin users
    return res.json({ message: 'Admin action performed' });
  }

  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Unauthorized action' });
});

app.get('/user', (req, res) => {
  if (req.user.roles.includes('user')) {
    // Authorized action for all users
    return res.json({ message: 'User action performed' });
  }

  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Unauthorized action' });
});
```

In the example above, we have a middleware that verifies the JWT and sets `req.user` with the decoded token. The `/admin` and `/user` routes are then protected using RBAC checks. Only users with the corresponding role can perform the authorized actions.

## Conclusion

Implementing Role-Based Access Control with JWTs provides a secure and scalable solution for controlling access to your web application's resources. By including role claims in JWTs, you can easily determine the actions a user is authorized to perform. This helps you build a robust and granular access control system for your application.
