Storing additional user data in JWT claims offers several benefits. It eliminates the need for frequent database queries to fetch user data and reduces the risk of inconsistent data across various microservices. Let's explore how to store additional user data in JWT claims using a Node.js and Express example.

First, let's assume you have a user database that contains user information such as username, email, and role. When a user successfully logs in, you can generate a JWT containing the standard claims and any additional user data you want to include. Here's an example using the `jsonwebtoken` library in Node.js:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const secretKey = 'your-secret-key'; // Replace with your secret key

// Generate JWT with additional user data
function generateJwt(user) {
  const payload = {
    sub: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    role: user.role,
    // Additional user-specific data
    name: user.name,
    age: user.age
  };

  return jwt.sign(payload, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });
}
```

In the above code snippet, we are including the user's name and age as additional data in the JWT's payload.

When a protected route is accessed, you can then verify the JWT and extract the additional user data from the claims. Here's an example middleware function that verifies the token and extracts the user's name and age:

```javascript
function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }

  jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
    }

    req.user = decoded; // Make the user data available in subsequent middleware or routes

    // Access additional user data
    const { name, age } = decoded;

    // Do something with the additional user data

    next();
  });
}
```

Remember to use proper error handling for your specific application and adjust the code according to your data structure and requirements. Storing additional user data in JWT claims provides an efficient way to access user-specific information without querying the database repeatedly, making it a valuable technique in modern application development.
