With the increasing usage of multi-device applications, it becomes necessary to consider the security implications of allowing users to simultaneously access their accounts on different devices. One important security feature to implement in such scenarios is token revocation and logout across multiple devices.

## Token Revocation

Token revocation is the process of invalidating or revoking an authentication token issued to a user. This ensures that even if an unauthorized party gains access to a user's token, they will not be able to use it to authenticate themselves.

### Token Storage

To implement token revocation, it is essential to store the issued tokens securely and associate them with the user's account. This can be achieved by using a secure database or session storage mechanism.

### Blacklisting Revoked Tokens

When a user requests a logout across all devices or if a user's account is compromised, all the associated tokens should be revoked. The revoked tokens are then stored in a blacklist, which is checked during the token validation process. Any token found in the blacklist is considered invalid.

## Logout Across Multiple Devices

Implementing a logout across multiple devices functionality allows users to remotely terminate all active sessions associated with their account.

### Managing Active Sessions

To enable logout from multiple devices, a record of active sessions for each user needs to be maintained. When a user logs in, a new session entry is created, and the session ID is associated with the user's account.

### Removing Active Sessions

To perform a logout across multiple devices, the user's account is flagged, indicating that all active sessions should be terminated. Upon the next request from each active session, the server identifies the account's status and ends the session.

## Conclusion

Implementing token revocation and logout across multiple devices is crucial in ensuring the security of user accounts in multi-device applications. By effectively managing tokens and actively terminating sessions, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to user accounts.
