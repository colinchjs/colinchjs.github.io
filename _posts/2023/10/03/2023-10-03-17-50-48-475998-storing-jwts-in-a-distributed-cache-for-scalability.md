With the rise of stateless authentication mechanisms like JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), it's crucial to have a highly scalable and performant solution for storing and validating these tokens. One approach to achieve scalability is to leverage a distributed cache system to store and retrieve JWTs. In this article, we will explore the benefits and considerations of using a distributed cache for storing JWTs, and provide some examples using popular caching systems.

## Why Use a Distributed Cache?

A distributed cache can provide several advantages when it comes to storing and managing JWTs in a scalable manner:

1. **Performance:** As JWTs are typically used for authentication and authorization, they are often required to be validated on each request. Storing JWTs in a distributed cache allows for efficient retrieval and validation, reducing the load on the authentication server.

2. **Scalability:** Distributed cache systems are designed to distribute data across multiple nodes, enabling horizontal scalability. This ensures high availability and performance even under heavy loads.

3. **Shared State:** Since JWTs are self-contained and do not require server-side storage, storing them in a distributed cache allows multiple servers to access and validate tokens seamlessly. This is especially useful in microservices architectures where authentication may be needed across multiple services.

## Choosing a Distributed Cache

There are several popular distributed cache systems to choose from, each with its own unique features and considerations. Here are a few examples:

### Redis

Redis is an in-memory data store known for its speed, simplicity, and rich data structures. It supports key-value operations and provides several advanced features like pub/sub messaging and Lua scripting. Storing JWTs in Redis can be as simple as setting a key-value pair where the key is the token ID and the value is the serialized JWT.

Example code in Python using Redis:

```python
import redis

redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)

def store_jwt(jwt_id, jwt):
    redis_client.set(jwt_id, jwt)

def retrieve_jwt(jwt_id):
    return redis_client.get(jwt_id)
```

### Memcached

Memcached is another popular distributed caching system known for its simplicity and fast access times. It provides a simple key-value store and is designed for high-performance, low-latency use cases. Storing JWTs in Memcached follows a similar pattern to Redis, with the token ID as the key and the serialized JWT as the value.

Example code in PHP using Memcached:

```php
$memcached = new Memcached();
$memcached->addServer('localhost', 11211);

function storeJwt($jwtId, $jwt) {
    $memcached->set($jwtId, $jwt);
}

function retrieveJwt($jwtId) {
    return $memcached->get($jwtId);
}
```

## Considerations and Best Practices

When storing JWTs in a distributed cache, it's important to consider the following best practices:

1. **Expiration:** Set an appropriate expiration time for stored JWTs to prevent stale tokens from being used. Take into account the token's expiration time and configure your cache accordingly.

2. **Revocation:** If JWT revocation is required, consider using a separate mechanism, like a blacklist or token revocation list (TRL), to track revoked tokens. This can be done by storing the revoked token IDs alongside valid tokens in the cache.

3. **Security:** Ensure that access to the cache is properly secured to prevent unauthorized access to stored JWTs. Employ secure configurations, like using encryption, access control, and secure network communication.

## Conclusion

Storing JWTs in a distributed cache offers significant performance and scalability benefits for managing authentication and authorization in a stateless manner. By leveraging popular caching systems like Redis or Memcached, you can achieve high availability and seamless token validation across multiple servers or services. However, ensure you follow the best practices mentioned to maintain security and avoid potential pitfalls.
