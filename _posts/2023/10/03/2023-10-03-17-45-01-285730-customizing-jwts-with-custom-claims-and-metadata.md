JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a popular means of authentication and authorization in modern web applications. JWTs consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The payload contains claims, which are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional metadata. 

While JWTs come with a standard set of claims, it is often necessary to include custom claims and metadata to meet the specific requirements of your application. Custom claims allow you to add additional information to the JWT payload, providing context or extending the functionality of your authentication system. Metadata, on the other hand, serves to provide additional information about the token itself.

## Adding Custom Claims

To add custom claims to a JWT, you need to include them in the payload section. Custom claims can be any key-value pair that provides relevant information about the user or the application. For example, you may want to include the user's role, permissions, or any other user-specific data.

Here's an example of a JWT payload with custom claims:

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true,
  "roles": ["user", "admin"],
  "iat": 1516239022
}
```

In this example, we have added the `admin` claim to indicate whether the user is an administrator or not. We have also added the `roles` claim to specify the roles assigned to the user.

## Including Metadata

Adding metadata to JWTs can be useful in various scenarios, such as token expiration, token revocation status, or any other information related to the token itself. Including metadata helps in making informed decisions about the token's validity and usage.

One common approach to include metadata is by adding an additional claim to the payload named `metadata`. The `metadata` claim can be a nested object that contains various metadata properties. For example:

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "exp": 1609459200,
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "revoked": false
  }
}
```

In this example, we have included a `metadata` claim that contains the `created_at` property indicating the token's creation timestamp and the `revoked` property to specify whether the token has been revoked.

## Conclusion

Customizing JWTs with custom claims and metadata allows you to tailor the tokens to your specific application needs. Custom claims provide additional information about the user, while metadata helps in managing and validating the token. By leveraging custom claims and metadata, you can enhance the security and functionality of your authentication system.
