In today's interconnected world, remote procedure calls (RPC) have become an essential part of modern applications. RPC allows different services to communicate with each other across networks, enabling seamless integration and modular application architectures. However, ensuring the security of these RPC calls is paramount to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

One effective approach to secure RPC calls is by using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are widely adopted in the industry for securing authorization and authentication processes. In this blog post, we will explore how JWTs can be leveraged to achieve secure RPCs.

## What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?

A JSON Web Token, or JWT, is a compact and self-contained way of transmitting information securely between parties as a JSON object. It consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header contains information about the token, such as the hashing algorithm used, while the payload carries the claims or assertions. The signature is generated using a secret key and is used to verify the integrity of the token.

## Using JWTs for Secure RPCs

To use JWTs for secure RPCs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Authentication**: When a client wants to make an RPC request, it first needs to authenticate itself. The client sends its credentials (e.g., username and password) to the authentication server.
2. **Token Generation**: Upon successful authentication, the authentication server generates a JWT containing relevant information and signs it with a secret key.
3. **Token Retrieval**: The generated JWT is then sent back to the client, which stores it securely. The client will include this token in the headers of subsequent RPC requests to identify itself.
4. **Token Verification**: When an RPC request is received, the service responsible for handling the request verifies the authenticity of the JWT by checking its signature. It also validates the claims to ensure the client has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.
5. **RPC Execution**: Upon successful verification, the RPC request is executed, and the service responds with the requested data or performs the desired action.
6. **Token Expiration and Renewal**: JWTs typically have an expiration time. Once a token has expired, the client needs to obtain a new token by repeating the authentication and token generation steps.

## Benefits of Using JWTs for Secure RPCs

By leveraging JWTs for secure RPCs, we can enjoy several benefits:

- **Stateless and Scalable**: JWTs are stateless, meaning the server does not need to store any session-related information. This makes the architecture highly scalable as servers can handle requests independently without relying on shared session storage.
- **Security and Trust**: JWTs have built-in security features like signature verification, ensuring the integrity of the token. Additionally, since the token is generated and signed by a trusted server, services can trust the authenticity of the client.
- **Authorization**: JWT payloads can contain claims or assertions about the client's permissions, enabling fine-grained authorization checks at the service level.
- **Interoperability**: JWTs follow a standardized format, making them compatible with various programming languages and frameworks.

## Conclusion

Secure RPCs are crucial to protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of applications. By utilizing JWTs, we can establish a secure and scalable communication channel between services. With their built-in security features and interoperability, JWTs provide an effective solution for implementing secure RPCs in modern applications.
