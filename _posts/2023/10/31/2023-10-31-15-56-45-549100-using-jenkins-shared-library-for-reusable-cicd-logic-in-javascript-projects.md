Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that allows you to automate various tasks, including building, testing, and deploying applications. One of the powerful features of Jenkins is the ability to create and use shared libraries, which enable you to define reusable CI/CD logic that can be utilized across multiple projects.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use Jenkins shared library to create reusable CI/CD logic specifically for JavaScript projects.

## Introduction to Jenkins Shared Library

Jenkins Shared Library allows you to define custom Groovy code that can be used by Jenkins pipelines. It provides a way to encapsulate common tasks and share them across multiple projects, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

## Setting Up the Jenkins Shared Library

1. Open your Jenkins dashboard and navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System".
2. Scroll down to the "Global Pipeline Libraries" section.
3. Click on "Add" to add a new shared library.
4. Enter a name for the library and provide the repository URL where your shared library code resides.
5. Save the configuration.

## Creating the Reusable CI/CD Logic

To create reusable CI/CD logic for JavaScript projects, you need to define a Groovy file in your shared library.

Here's an example of a `build.groovy` file that defines a function for building a JavaScript project:

```groovy
def call() {
  stage('Build') {
    // Checkout the code from version control repository
    checkout scm
    
    // Install project dependencies
    sh 'npm install'
    
    // Run build script
    sh 'npm run build'
  }
}
```

In this example, the `call` method defines the logic for the build stage. It checks out the code, installs project dependencies using npm, and runs the build script.

You can define additional stages such as testing, linting, and deployment according to your project requirements.

## Using the Shared Library in JavaScript Projects

To use the shared library in your Jenkins pipeline for a JavaScript project, you need to define a `Jenkinsfile` in your project repository.

Here's an example of a `Jenkinsfile` that utilizes the shared library:

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-library') _

pipeline {
  agent any
  
  stages {
    stage('Build and Test') {
      steps {
        script {
          build()
          // Additional steps for testing
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Other stages e.g., linting, deployment, etc.
  }
}
```

In this example, the `@Library` annotation specifies the name of the shared library (`my-shared-library`). The `pipeline` block defines the stages for the CI/CD process. Inside the `steps` block, you can call the `build` function from the shared library to perform the build stage.

## Conclusion

Using Jenkins shared library allows you to define and reuse CI/CD logic across JavaScript projects, improving productivity and maintaining consistency in your CI/CD process. By encapsulating commonly used tasks, you can easily manage and update your pipelines as your projects evolve.

By leveraging the power of Jenkins shared library in your JavaScript projects, you can streamline your CI/CD workflows and focus more on building and delivering high-quality software.

Make sure to check the official Jenkins documentation for more detailed information on using shared libraries and customizing your pipelines.
