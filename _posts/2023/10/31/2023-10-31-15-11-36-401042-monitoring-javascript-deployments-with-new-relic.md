As our applications become more complex and rely heavily on JavaScript, it is crucial to have a robust monitoring system in place to ensure smooth deployments. One popular monitoring tool that can help us achieve this is New Relic.

In this blog post, we will explore how to set up and use New Relic to monitor our JavaScript deployments effectively. We will cover the following topics:

1. Introduction to New Relic
2. Setting up New Relic for JavaScript monitoring
3. Monitoring JavaScript errors
4. Monitoring JavaScript performance
5. Analyzing deployment impact
6. Setting up alerts
7. Best practices for New Relic monitoring

## 1. Introduction to New Relic

New Relic is a powerful Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool that provides deep insights into the performance and availability of your applications. It offers monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for various programming languages, including JavaScript.

## 2. Setting up New Relic for JavaScript monitoring

To start monitoring JavaScript deployments with New Relic, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a New Relic account at [https://newrelic.com/](https://newrelic.com/).
2. Create a new application in New Relic and choose JavaScript as the application type.
3. Install the New Relic Browser agent in your application by adding the JavaScript snippet provided by New Relic to your HTML files.

## 3. Monitoring JavaScript errors

One of the essential aspects of monitoring JavaScript deployments is tracking and resolving errors. New Relic provides detailed error reporting, including stack traces, error messages, and affected browsers.

To monitor JavaScript errors in New Relic:

1. Navigate to the JavaScript errors section in the New Relic dashboard.
2. Analyze the error occurrences, error rates, and user impacts.
3. Dive into specific errors to identify the root cause and troubleshoot.

## 4. Monitoring JavaScript performance

Next, we need to ensure that our JavaScript code is performing optimally. New Relic allows us to measure the performance of our applications and identify potential bottlenecks.

To monitor JavaScript performance in New Relic:

1. Explore the JavaScript performance section in the New Relic dashboard.
2. Check for long-running scripts, slowest functions, and network performance.
3. Identify areas for optimization and improve the overall performance of your application.

## 5. Analyzing deployment impact

With New Relic, we can track the impact of our deployments on our JavaScript applications. Monitoring deployment impact helps us identify any adverse effects and gives us the ability to roll back changes if necessary.

To analyze deployment impact in New Relic:

1. Navigate to the deployments section in the New Relic dashboard.
2. View the deployment history, including the versions deployed and their impact on performance and errors.
3. Use this information to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions if required.

## 6. Setting up alerts

New Relic allows us to set up alerts and notifications based on specific thresholds or conditions. Setting up alerts will help us proactively identify any issues with our JavaScript deployments and address them promptly.

To set up alerts in New Relic:

1. Go to the alerts section in the New Relic dashboard.
2. Configure alert conditions based on error rates, response times, or any other important metrics.
3. Choose the notification channels, such as email or Slack, to be alerted when the conditions are met.

## 7. Best practices for New Relic monitoring

To get the most out of New Relic for monitoring JavaScript deployments, consider the following best practices:

- Regularly review and analyze the monitoring data to identify trends and performance patterns.
- Use custom attributes and tags in New Relic to add context and gain deeper insights.
- Collaborate with your development team to address any performance issues or error trends.
- Continuously optimize and refactor your JavaScript code based on insights from New Relic.

With New Relic, we have a powerful tool at our disposal to monitor and optimize our JavaScript deployments. By following the steps outlined in this blog post and adopting best practices, we can ensure the smooth and efficient functioning of our JavaScript applications.
