In web development, caching plays a crucial role in improving performance and reducing network requests. The JavaScript Cache API provides a way to store responses from network requests, allowing them to be retrieved quickly and efficiently. However, it is important to understand the expiration and eviction options available in the Cache API to effectively manage cached data.

## Understanding Cache Expiration

Cache expiration refers to the time period after which a cached response is considered stale and should no longer be used. The Cache API allows you to set an expiration time for cached responses using the `Cache-Control` header of the response.

```javascript
const cacheName = 'my-cache';

// Open the cache
caches.open(cacheName).then((cache) => {

  // Make a network request and store the response in the cache
  fetch('https://example.com/data').then((response) => {
    
    // Clone the response so it can be stored in the cache
    const clonedResponse = response.clone();

    // Set the caching options
    const cacheOptions = {
      status: response.status,
      headers: {
        'Cache-Control': 'max-age=3600' // Set the expiration time to 1 hour
      }
    };

    // Store the response in the cache
    cache.put(request, clonedResponse, cacheOptions);
  });

});
```

In the above example, a network request is made to `'https://example.com/data'` and the resulting response is stored in the cache. The `max-age` value is set to `3600` seconds (1 hour), indicating that the response should be considered fresh for the next hour.

## Handling Cache Eviction

Cache eviction refers to the removal of cached responses from the cache. By default, the Cache API does not automatically remove or update cached responses. However, you can manually handle cache eviction by implementing a cache clean-up process that removes expired or unwanted items from the cache.

Here's an example of how you can implement cache eviction in JavaScript:

```javascript
const cacheName = 'my-cache';

// Clean up expired items in the cache
caches.open(cacheName).then((cache) => {
  cache.keys().then((keys) => {
    keys.forEach((key) => {
      cache.match(key).then((response) => {
        if (response.headers.get('expires') < Date.now()) {
          cache.delete(key);
        }
      });
    });
  });
});
```

In the above example, we iterate through each key in the cache and check if the corresponding response's `expires` header is older than the current time. If it is, we delete the entry from the cache.

It's important to note that cache eviction is a manual process, and you need to implement logic to determine when and how to remove unwanted items from the cache. One common approach is to periodically check the `expires` header and remove expired items during a regular clean-up routine.

By understanding cache expiration and eviction options in the JavaScript Cache API, you can effectively manage cached data, ensuring that your web application remains performant and up-to-date.
