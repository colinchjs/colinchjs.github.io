In today's web development landscape, user experience is a top priority. This includes ensuring that our web applications deliver a smooth and responsive experience, even when performing computationally intensive tasks like image processing. 

To achieve this, we can leverage web workers, a feature available in modern browsers that allows us to run JavaScript code in the background without blocking the main thread. This can significantly improve the performance of our web applications, especially when dealing with tasks such as image processing.

In this blog post, we will explore a couple of examples that demonstrate how web workers can be used for image processing.

## Example 1: Image Filtering

```javascript
// main.js
const imageFilterWorker = new Worker('imageFilterWorker.js');

imageFilterWorker.onmessage = function (event) {
  const filteredImageData = event.data;
  // Render the filtered image onto the canvas
  renderImage(filteredImageData);
};

function applyImageFilter(imageData) {
  imageFilterWorker.postMessage(imageData);
}

function renderImage(imageData) {
  // Rendering logic goes here
}

// imageFilterWorker.js
self.onmessage = function (event) {
  const imageData = event.data;
  const filteredImageData = applyFilter(imageData);
  self.postMessage(filteredImageData);
};

function applyFilter(imageData) {
  // Image filtering logic goes here
}
```

In this example, we have a main JavaScript file (`main.js`) and a separate web worker file (`imageFilterWorker.js`). The main JavaScript file creates a web worker and assigns an `onmessage` event handler to receive the filtered image data. The `applyImageFilter` function is responsible for sending the image data to the web worker using `postMessage`.

The web worker file (`imageFilterWorker.js`) sets its own `onmessage` event listener to handle the incoming image data. It applies the desired image filter using the `applyFilter` function and sends the filtered image data back to the main thread using `postMessage`.

## Example 2: Image Compression

```javascript
// main.js
const imageCompressionWorker = new Worker('imageCompressionWorker.js');

imageCompressionWorker.onmessage = function (event) {
  const compressedImageData = event.data;
  // Render the compressed image onto the canvas
  renderImage(compressedImageData);
};

function compressImage(imageData) {
  imageCompressionWorker.postMessage(imageData);
}

// imageCompressionWorker.js
const imageCompressionRatio = 0.5;

self.onmessage = function (event) {
  const imageData = event.data;
  const compressedImageData = compressImage(imageData);
  self.postMessage(compressedImageData);
};

function compressImage(imageData) {
  // Image compression logic goes here
  // Use imageCompressionRatio to control the compression level
}
```

In this example, we have another pair of JavaScript files where the main JavaScript file (`main.js`) communicates with a web worker (`imageCompressionWorker.js`) for image compression. The main difference in this example is that we don't have separate rendering logic, as we are only focused on image compression.

Similar to the previous example, the main JavaScript file creates a web worker and assigns an `onmessage` event handler to receive the compressed image data. The `compressImage` function sends the image data to the web worker using `postMessage`.

The web worker file listens for incoming messages using the `onmessage` event and applies the image compression logic, with the `imageCompressionRatio` controlling the compression level. It then sends the compressed image data back using `postMessage`.

By utilizing web workers in these examples, we prevent blocking the main thread and ensure a smooth user experience even during image processing tasks. This results in faster page load times and responsive web applications.
