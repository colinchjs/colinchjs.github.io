With traditional JavaScript execution, the browser's main thread is responsible for handling user interactions, rendering the UI, and executing JavaScript code. If a time-consuming task is performed on the main thread, it can cause the UI to freeze, resulting in a poor user experience.

This is where Web Workers come into play. They enable us to offload heavy tasks to separate threads, keeping the main thread free to handle user interactions and updates to the UI. This helps in maintaining a smooth and responsive user interface.

To use Web Workers, we need to create a new JavaScript file dedicated to the worker task. Inside this file, we write the code that executes in the background thread. We then create a new `Worker` object in our main JavaScript file and pass the URL of the worker file as an argument.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of Web Workers:

```javascript
// main.js

// Create a new Worker object
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');

// Handle messages sent by the worker
worker.onmessage = function (event) {
  const result = event.data;
  console.log('Received result:', result);
};

// Start the worker task
worker.postMessage(10);
```

```javascript
// worker.js

// Handle the message sent by the main script
self.onmessage = function (event) {
  const number = event.data;
  
  // Perform time-consuming calculations
  const result = fibonacci(number);
  
  // Send the result back to the main script
  self.postMessage(result);
};

// A function to calculate the Fibonacci series
function fibonacci(n) {
  return n <= 1 ? n : fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

In this example, the main script creates a new `Worker` object and registers an event handler to receive messages from the worker. When the worker completes its task, it sends back a message containing the result. The main script then logs the result to the console.

The worker script performs a time-consuming calculation of the Fibonacci series and sends the result back to the main script.

By using Web Workers, we can execute computationally intensive tasks without blocking the main thread. This helps in improving web page responsiveness and ensures a smooth user experience.
