To get started with Web Workers, you first need to create a new worker using the Worker constructor. The worker script can be a separate JavaScript file or an inline script defined within the HTML file. Here's an example of an inline worker script:

```javascript
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');

worker.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log('Image rendering complete:', event.data);
};

worker.onerror = function(error) {
  console.error('Worker error:', error.message);
};

worker.postMessage('image.jpg');
```

In this example, we create a new worker by passing the path to the worker script as an argument to the Worker constructor. We then define two event handlers: `onmessage` and `onerror`. The `onmessage` handler will be invoked when the worker sends a message back to the main thread, while the `onerror` handler will be triggered if an error occurs within the worker.

Inside the worker script (worker.js), we can handle the image rendering process. Here's a basic example using the HTML canvas API:

```javascript
self.onmessage = function(event) {
  const image = new Image();

  image.onload = function() {
    const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(image.width, image.height);
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    // Perform image rendering operations here

    const renderedImage = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg');
    self.postMessage(renderedImage);
  };

  image.onerror = function() {
    self.postMessage(null);
  };

  image.src = event.data;
};
```

In this example, we listen for the `onmessage` event in the worker script and create a new `Image` object. We assign an `onload` event handler to the image, which will be triggered once the image is loaded. Inside the `onload` handler, we create an `OffscreenCanvas` and a 2D rendering context (`ctx`). We can perform various image rendering operations using the canvas API.

Once the rendering is complete, we use the `toDataURL` method to convert the rendered image to a data URL. We then send the data URL back to the main thread using `postMessage`.

Using Web Workers for multi-threaded image rendering can significantly improve performance, especially on devices with multiple CPU cores. By offloading computationally intensive tasks to a separate thread, we can prevent the main thread from blocking and provide a more responsive user interface.
