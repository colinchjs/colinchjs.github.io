In this tutorial, we will explore how to create a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application using child processes in Node.js. A CLI allows users to interact with a program using commands entered in the terminal. We will leverage the built-in `child_process` module in Node.js to execute shell commands and capture their output.

## Introduction

CLI applications are widely used for various tasks, such as automating repetitive tasks, system administration, and interacting with external services. By creating a CLI, you expose your functionality to users who prefer working with the command line interface.

Node.js provides the `child_process` module that enables us to create child processes, which can execute shell commands from within our Node.js application.

## Setting up the Project

To get started, let's set up a new Node.js project by creating a directory and initializing a new `package.json` file:

```bash
mkdir my-cli
cd my-cli
npm init -y
```

## Using Child Processes

The `child_process` module provides multiple methods to create child processes. The two most commonly used methods are `exec()` and `spawn()`. 

The `exec()` method is suitable when we want to execute a command in a shell and capture its output. The `spawn()` method is useful when we need to stream data between the parent and child processes.

For this tutorial, we will use the `exec()` method as it simplifies capturing the command output. 

## Running Shell Commands

To run shell commands using the `exec()` method, we first need to require the `child_process` module:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');
```

Next, we can use the `exec()` method to execute the desired command:

```javascript
exec('ls -l', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
        console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
        return;
    }
    if (stderr) {
        console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
        return;
    }
    console.log(`stdout:\n${stdout}`);
});
```

In this example, we execute the `ls -l` command to list the files and directories in the current directory. The output is captured and logged to the console.

## Capturing Output

The `exec()` method takes a callback function as its second argument, which is invoked once the command execution is complete. The callback function is passed three arguments: `error`, `stdout`, and `stderr`.

- `error`: If the execution encounters an error, this argument will contain the error object.
- `stdout`: The standard output from the command.
- `stderr`: The standard error from the command.

By checking these values, we can handle errors or display specific messages to the user.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to create a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application using child processes in Node.js. We learned how to use the `child_process` module to execute shell commands and capture their output. By leveraging the power of child processes, we can create powerful CLI applications that are flexible and easy to use.

Be sure to check out the official Node.js documentation for the `child_process` module for more advanced usage and additional options.

Happy coding!
