In Node.js, we can easily create child processes to run separate applications or commands. This feature comes in handy when we want to run a web server as a child process, allowing our main application to continue executing without being blocked.

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to run a web server as a child process in Node.js, using the `child_process` module. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

## Creating a Web Server

Before running a web server as a child process, let's first create a basic web server in Node.js. Create a new file called `server.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

Save the file and run the server using the command `node server.js`. This will start the web server on port 3000.

## Running the Web Server as a Child Process

Now, let's modify our main application to run the web server as a child process. Open a new file called `main.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const serverProcess = spawn('node', ['server.js']);

serverProcess.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`Server output: ${data}`);
});

serverProcess.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  console.error(`Server error: ${data}`);
});

serverProcess.on('close', (code) => {
  console.log(`Server process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```

In this code, we use the `spawn` function from the `child_process` module to start the `server.js` file as a separate child process. The `spawn` function takes the command (`node`) and the arguments (`['server.js']`) as parameters.

We also attach event listeners to the child process to handle the output and errors. The `stdout` event is triggered when there is output from the child process, while the `stderr` event handles any errors that occur in the child process.

To run the main application, execute the command `node main.js`. This will start the web server as a child process.

## Handling Communications

To communicate between the main application and the child process, you can use inter-process communication (IPC) channels. These channels allow you to send messages back and forth.

To send a message from the child process to the main application, use the `process.send()` method. In the main application, you can listen for messages using the `process.on('message')` event.

For a more detailed explanation of how to handle communications between the main application and the child process, refer to the official Node.js documentation.

## Conclusion

Running a web server as a child process in Node.js is a powerful technique that allows us to separate the server logic from the main application. This helps to improve the performance and stability of our applications by keeping them non-blocking.

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a basic web server, run it as a child process, and handle communications between the main application and the child process.
