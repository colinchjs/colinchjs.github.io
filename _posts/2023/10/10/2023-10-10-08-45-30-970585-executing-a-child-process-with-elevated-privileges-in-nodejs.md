When working with Node.js, there may be situations where you need to execute a child process with elevated privileges, such as running a command that requires administrative rights. In this article, we will explore how to accomplish this in a cross-platform manner using the built-in `child_process` module.

## The `child_process` module in Node.js

The `child_process` module in Node.js provides a way to spawn child processes and communicate with them. It allows you to execute external commands or scripts, providing a powerful means to extend the functionality of your Node.js applications.

## Using `child_process` to execute a command with elevated privileges

To execute a command with elevated privileges, you can make use of the `sudo` command available on most Unix-like systems. However, Windows does not have a built-in equivalent, so we will need to employ a different approach.

### Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, etc.)

On Unix-like systems, you can use the `sudo` command to execute a command with elevated privileges. Here's an example using the `exec` method from the `child_process` module:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('sudo rm -rf /tmp', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    return;
  }
  if (stderr) {
    console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
});
```

In this example, we are executing the `sudo rm -rf /tmp` command, which removes the `/tmp` directory with elevated privileges. The `exec` method allows us to pass in the command and a callback function to handle the results or errors.

### Windows systems

On Windows, the `child_process` module does not provide a direct way to execute commands with elevated privileges. However, you can make use of tools like `runas` or `psexec` to accomplish this. Here's an example using the `exec` method with `runas`:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('runas /user:Administrator "rmdir /s /q C:\\Temp"', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    return;
  }
  if (stderr) {
    console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
});
```

In this example, we are using the `runas` command to execute the `rmdir /s /q C:\\Temp` command, which recursively removes the `C:\\Temp` directory with elevated privileges. Note that you may need to replace `'Administrator'` with the appropriate Windows user that has administrative privileges.

## Conclusion

Executing a child process with elevated privileges can be a powerful capability in certain scenarios. In this article, we explored how to achieve this using the `child_process` module in Node.js. By using the `sudo` command on Unix-like systems and external tools like `runas` on Windows, you can execute commands that require elevated privileges and extend the functionality of your Node.js applications.
