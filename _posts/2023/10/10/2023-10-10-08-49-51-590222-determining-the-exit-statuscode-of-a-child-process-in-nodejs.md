When working with child processes in Node.js, it is often necessary to determine the exit status or code of the child process. The exit status indicates whether the child process completed successfully or if an error occurred. In this blog post, we will explore how to determine the exit status or code of a child process in Node.js.

## The `child_process` Module
The `child_process` module in Node.js provides functionality for working with child processes. It allows us to spawn new processes, interact with them, and capture their output.

### Spawning a Child Process
To spawn a child process, we can use the `spawn()` method provided by the `child_process` module. Here's an example:

```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const childProcess = spawn('ls', ['-l']);

childProcess.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
});

childProcess.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
});

childProcess.on('close', (code) => {
  console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```

In the above example, we are spawning a child process to execute the `ls -l` command. We attach event listeners to capture the child process's stdout, stderr, and the `close` event, which is emitted when the child process exits.

## Determine Exit Status/Code
There are multiple ways to determine the exit status or code of a child process in Node.js. Let's explore two common approaches.

### Using the `exitCode` Property
After a child process exits, Node.js sets the `exitCode` property on the child process object. We can use this property to determine the exit code. Here's an example:

```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const childProcess = spawn('ls', ['-l']);

childProcess.on('close', (code) => {
  if (code === 0) {
    console.log('Child process completed successfully');
  } else {
    console.error('Child process exited with error');
  }
});
```

In the above example, we check the `code` value passed to the `close` event listener. If the code is `0`, it means the child process completed successfully. Any other value indicates an error occurred.

### Using the `on('exit')` Event
Another way to determine the exit status or code of a child process is by listening to the `exit` event. This event is emitted when the child process exits and provides the exit code as an argument. Here's an example:

```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const childProcess = spawn('ls', ['-l']);

childProcess.on('exit', (code) => {
  if (code === 0) {
    console.log('Child process completed successfully');
  } else {
    console.error('Child process exited with error');
  }
});
```

In the above example, the `exit` event is used instead of the `close` event to determine the exit code.

## Conclusion
Determining the exit status or code of a child process in Node.js is essential for handling errors and ensuring the proper execution of your application. In this blog post, we explored two common ways to determine the exit status or code using the `child_process` module. By leveraging these techniques, you can effectively handle child processes and build robust Node.js applications.
