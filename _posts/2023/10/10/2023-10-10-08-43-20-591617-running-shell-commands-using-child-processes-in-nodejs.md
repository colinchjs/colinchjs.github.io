When building applications with Node.js, there may be a need to execute shell commands from within your application. This could be for tasks like running system commands, executing scripts, or interacting with external dependencies. Node.js provides a built-in module called `child_process` that allows you to run shell commands and capture their output.

## Using the child_process module

To use the `child_process` module in Node.js, you need to require it first:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');
```

The `exec` function in the `child_process` module creates a new shell process and runs the provided command inside it. Here's a simple example of running a shell command using `exec`:

```javascript
exec('ls -l', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error executing command: ${error}`);
    return;
  }

  console.log(`Command output:\n ${stdout}`);
  console.error(`Command errors:\n ${stderr}`);
});
```

In this example, we're using the `ls -l` command to list the files and directories in the current directory. The `exec` function takes a command as its first argument and a callback function as its second argument. The callback function is invoked when the command execution is complete, and it receives three parameters: `error`, `stdout` (standard output), and `stderr` (standard error).

## Running shell commands with options

The `exec` function allows you to specify additional options when running shell commands. For example, you can set the current working directory, pass environment variables, or specify a timeout for command execution. Here's an example that demonstrates some of these options:

```javascript
const options = {
  cwd: '/path/to/directory', // Set the current working directory of the shell command
  env: { NODE_ENV: 'production' }, // Pass environment variables
  timeout: 5000, // Set a timeout for command execution (in milliseconds)
};

exec('npm install', options, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  // Handle the command output and errors
});
```

## Spawning long-running processes

If you need to execute long-running processes that produce continuous output, the `spawn` function is a better option than `exec`. The `spawn` function creates a child process that remains open for communication. You can read the output of the child process or send input to it.

Here's a basic example of using `spawn` to run a long-running process and read its output:

```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const process = spawn('node', ['myScript.js']);

process.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`Process output: ${data}`);
});

process.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  console.error(`Process error: ${data}`);
});

process.on('close', (code) => {
  console.log(`Process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```

In this example, we're spawning a Node.js script called `myScript.js`. The `spawn` function takes the command to run as its first argument and an array of command-line arguments as its second argument.

## Conclusion

The `child_process` module in Node.js provides a powerful way to run shell commands from within your applications. Whether you need to execute short-lived commands or long-running processes, the built-in functions like `exec` and `spawn` allow you to run shell commands seamlessly. By using the functionality provided by the `child_process` module, you can extend the capabilities of your Node.js applications and integrate with the underlying system.
