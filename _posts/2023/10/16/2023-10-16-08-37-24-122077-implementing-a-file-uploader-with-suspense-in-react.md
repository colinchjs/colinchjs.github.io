In this article, we will explore how to implement a file uploader component using the new React Suspense feature. Suspense allows us to handle components that have asynchronous dependencies, such as data fetching or file uploading, in a more elegant and streamlined way.

## Introduction
With the introduction of React Suspense, handling asynchronous operations in React has become much easier. Suspense allows us to suspend rendering until all the required data or resources are available, without the need for complex state management or loading components.

In this tutorial, we will build a simple file uploader component using the Suspense feature provided by React to handle the asynchronous file upload process.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and NPM or Yarn
- React 16.6 or above

## Setting up the file uploader component
First, let's create a new React component called `FileUploader`. We will start by creating a basic file input element that allows users to select and upload a single file.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const FileUploader = () => {
  const handleFileUpload = (event) => {
    // Handle file upload logic here
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="file" onChange={handleFileUpload} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default FileUploader;
```

## Implementing the file upload logic
To handle the file upload logic, we can use the `fetch` API to send a POST request to a server endpoint. Let's update our `handleFileUpload` function to include the file upload logic.

```jsx
const handleFileUpload = async (event) => {
  const file = event.target.files[0];
  
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  
  const response = await fetch('/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  console.log('File uploaded successfully:', data);
};
```

In the code above, we create a new `FormData` object and append the selected file to it. Then, we make a `POST` request to `/upload` endpoint with the `FormData` as the request body. Finally, we parse the response and log it to the console.

## Displaying the file upload progress
To display the file upload progress, we can utilize the `fetch` API's `UploadProgress` event. Let's update our `handleFileUpload` function to include a progress bar and update it with the upload progress.

```jsx
const handleUploadProgress = (event) => {
  const { loaded, total } = event;
  
  const progress = Math.round((loaded / total) * 100);
  // Update the progress bar with the calculated percentage
};

const handleFileUpload = async (event) => {
  // ...
  
  const response = await fetch('/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });
  
  const reader = response.body.getReader();
  
  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read();
    
    if (done) {
      console.log('File uploaded successfully');
      break;
    }
    
    handleUploadProgress({ loaded: value.byteLength, total: file.size });
  }
};
```

In the updated code, we listen for the `UploadProgress` event by utilizing the `response.body.getReader()` method. Inside the loop, we calculate the upload progress percentage and update it accordingly. Once the upload is complete, we log a success message to the console.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we implemented a file uploader component using the new React Suspense feature. We covered how to handle the file upload process asynchronously and display the upload progress using the `fetch` API. 

React Suspense simplifies handling asynchronous operations in React by providing an efficient and declarative way to manage dependencies. With Suspense, building complex and asynchronous components, like our file uploader, becomes much easier and more intuitive.

Make sure to check out the official React documentation for more details on using Suspense.
