## Introduction to ARIA
ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It is a specification developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to improve the accessibility of web content and applications for people with disabilities. ARIA provides a toolkit of roles, properties, and states that enable developers to make their web applications more accessible.

## What is `aria-multiline`?
The `aria-multiline` attribute is used to indicate whether a text input or textarea element supports multiline input. It informs assistive technologies, such as screen readers, about the behavior of the input field.

By default, most text input and textarea elements allow multiline input. However, in some cases, developers might want to restrict the input to a single line for various reasons, such as formatting constraints or specific input requirements.

## How to Use `aria-multiline`
To use the `aria-multiline` attribute, simply add it to the text input or textarea element and set its value to either "true" or "false". The value "true" indicates that multiline input is allowed, while "false" indicates that only single-line input is allowed.

Here's an example of how to use the attribute in an HTML textarea element:

```html
<textarea aria-multiline="true"></textarea>
```

In this example, the `aria-multiline` attribute is set to "true", indicating that the textarea element supports multiline input.

## Example Code
Let's take a closer look at an example that demonstrates the use of the `aria-multiline` attribute in a text input and a textarea element.

```html
<input type="text" aria-multiline="false" />
<textarea aria-multiline="true"></textarea>
```

In the above code snippet, the `aria-multiline` attribute is set to "false" for the text input element, indicating that only single-line input is allowed. On the other hand, the `aria-multiline` attribute is set to "true" for the textarea element, indicating that it supports multiline input.

## Conclusion
The `aria-multiline` attribute is a useful tool for developers to communicate the behavior of text input and textarea elements to assistive technologies. By providing this information, developers can ensure that their web applications are accessible to users with disabilities.

By understanding and utilizing the ARIA standards, we can make significant strides in creating inclusive and accessible web applications.
