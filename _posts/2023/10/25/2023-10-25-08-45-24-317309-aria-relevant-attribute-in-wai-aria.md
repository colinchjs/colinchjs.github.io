In web development, accessibility is a crucial aspect to ensure that websites and web applications can be used by individuals with disabilities. The Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) is a set of attributes and roles that can be added to HTML elements to enhance accessibility.

One such attribute is `aria-relevant`, which is used to define what changes to an element's content or attribute values should be conveyed to the user. It informs assistive technologies about which updates are important and should be announced to the user.

The `aria-relevant` attribute accepts a space-separated list of values, including:

- `additions`: Indicates that additions to an element's content or attribute values should be announced.
- `removals`: Indicates that removals from an element's content or attribute values should be announced.
- `text`: Indicates that changes to an element's text content should be announced.
- `all`: Indicates that all changes to an element's content or attribute values should be announced.

Here's an example of how the `aria-relevant` attribute can be used:

```html
<button aria-relevant="additions text" aria-live="polite">Click Me</button>
```

In this example, the `aria-relevant` attribute is set to `"additions text"`. This means that when there are additions to the button's content or changes to its text, assistive technologies should announce those changes to the user.

It's important to note that the `aria-relevant` attribute works in conjunction with the `aria-live` attribute, which specifies how the information should be announced to the user. In the above example, the `aria-live` attribute is set to `"polite"`, which means that the changes should be announced without interrupting the user's current task.

By using the `aria-relevant` attribute appropriately, developers can ensure that important updates to web content are communicated effectively to users who rely on assistive technologies. This helps to create a more inclusive and accessible web experience for all users.

For more information on the `aria-relevant` attribute and other WAI-ARIA features, refer to the [WAI-ARIA specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/).
