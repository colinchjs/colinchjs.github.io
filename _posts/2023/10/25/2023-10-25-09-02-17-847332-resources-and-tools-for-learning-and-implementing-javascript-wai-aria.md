With the ever-evolving landscape of web development, it is essential to build accessible websites that can be used by individuals with disabilities. One crucial aspect of web accessibility is ensuring that our web applications are compatible with assistive technologies such as screen readers. The Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) provides a specification to help developers enhance the accessibility of their JavaScript-powered applications.

In this article, we will explore some valuable resources and tools that will aid in learning and implementing JavaScript WAI-ARIA effectively.

## 1. Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Documentation

When it comes to web development documentation, the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is undeniably one of the best resources available. MDN provides comprehensive and easy-to-understand documentation on various web technologies, including JavaScript and WAI-ARIA.

The MDN documentation on WAI-ARIA provides detailed explanations of ARIA roles, states, and properties, as well as examples of their usage. It also covers the recommended techniques and best practices for implementing WAI-ARIA in web applications. With its well-organized structure and clear explanations, MDN is an excellent starting point for learning about JavaScript WAI-ARIA.
