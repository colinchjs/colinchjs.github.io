In older versions of JavaScript, such as ES5 or ES6, you can achieve similar functionality using workarounds like using the `require` function in Node.js or `System.import` in some browsers. These approaches allow you to load modules dynamically, but they are not as intuitive or flexible as dynamic imports in ES2018.

Here's an example of how you can use a workaround in Node.js using the `require` function:

```
if (condition) {
  const module = require('./path/to/module');
  // Use the dynamically loaded module
} else {
  // Do something else
}
```

In this case, the module is only loaded and executed if the condition is true.

Keep in mind that these workarounds have limitations and may not provide the same level of functionality as dynamic imports in newer versions of JavaScript. If you're working with older versions of JavaScript and need the full power of dynamic imports, consider using a build tool or transpiler like webpack or Babel to convert your code to a version of JavaScript that supports dynamic imports.

With the wide adoption of modern JavaScript in browsers and Node.js, it's generally recommended to use the latest version of JavaScript and take advantage of its features whenever possible.
