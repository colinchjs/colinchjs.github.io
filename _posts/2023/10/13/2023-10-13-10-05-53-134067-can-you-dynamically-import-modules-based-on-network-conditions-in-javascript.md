To dynamically import a module based on network conditions, you can use the `navigator.onLine` property to check if the user is currently online. If the user is online, you can import the module using the `import()` function. If the user is offline, you can handle the situation accordingly.

Here's an example of how you can dynamically import a module based on network conditions:

```javascript
// Check if the user is online
if (navigator.onLine) {
  // Dynamically import the module
  import('./myModule.js')
    .then(module => {
      // Use the imported module
      module.myFunction();
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error('Error importing module:', error);
    });
} else {
  // Handle the offline scenario
  console.log('User is offline');
}
```

In the above example, if the user is online (`navigator.onLine` returns `true`), the `myModule.js` module will be dynamically imported using the `import()` function. Once the module is imported, you can use its functions or variables as needed. If the user is offline, you can handle the scenario accordingly, for example, by showing an offline message or using cached data.

It's important to note that dynamic imports are supported in most modern browsers, but not in older versions of Internet Explorer. Therefore, if you need to support older browsers, you may need to use a module bundler or a polyfill to achieve similar functionality.
