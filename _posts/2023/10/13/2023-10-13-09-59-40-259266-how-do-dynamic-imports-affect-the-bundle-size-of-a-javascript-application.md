When building a JavaScript application, one of the key considerations is the bundle size. A larger bundle size can negatively impact the application's performance, especially for users on slower network connections or devices with limited resources. 

Dynamic imports, introduced in ECMAScript 2020, offer a way to load JavaScript modules on-demand at runtime instead of including them in the initial bundle. This can be especially useful for applications with large or rarely used modules.

By using dynamic imports, modules can be loaded asynchronously, thus reducing the initial bundle size and improving the application's overall performance. Any modules that are not immediately required by the application can be fetched from the server only when they are needed.

Let's consider an example to better understand the impact of dynamic imports on bundle size. Assume we have a large application with multiple features, each implemented as a separate JavaScript module.

In a traditional approach, all the modules would be bundled together, regardless of whether they are immediately required or not. This results in a larger bundle size, as all modules are included upfront.

However, by leveraging dynamic imports, we can split the application into separate chunks and load them only when necessary. For example, if a specific feature is accessed by the user, the corresponding module will be dynamically loaded and executed. This allows the main bundle to remain smaller, as it only includes the essential modules needed for the initial page load.

It's worth noting that dynamic imports require the use of JavaScript's `import()` function, which returns a promise that resolves to the module. This means that using dynamic imports requires handling the asynchronous nature of loading the modules. 

To summarize, dynamic imports can significantly impact the bundle size of a JavaScript application by allowing for module loading on-demand. By loading modules only when needed, the initial bundle size can be reduced, resulting in improved performance. However, it's important to consider the additional complexity of handling asynchronous module loading when using dynamic imports.
