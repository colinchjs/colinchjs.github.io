To dynamically import multiple modules, you can use the `import()` function along with the `Promise.all()` method. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```javascript
const moduleNames = ['module1', 'module2', 'module3'];

Promise.all(moduleNames.map(module => import(`./${module}.js`)))
  .then(modules => {
    // You can access the imported modules here
    modules.forEach(module => {
      // Use the imported modules
      console.log(module);
    });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any import errors here
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In the above example, the `moduleNames` array contains the names of the modules you want to import dynamically. The `map()` method is used to transform each module name into a dynamic import statement. The resulting array of promises is passed to `Promise.all()`, which waits for all the promises to resolve.

Once all the modules are imported, the `then()` method is triggered, and you can access the imported modules inside the callback function. In this example, we simply log each imported module to the console.

If any import fails, the `catch()` method will be triggered, allowing you to handle any errors that occur during the dynamic import process.

Using this approach, you can easily load multiple modules dynamically without explicitly importing them in your initial script. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you only need certain modules under specific conditions or when optimizing the loading of your application.

Give it a try and take advantage of JavaScript's dynamic imports to make your code more flexible and efficient!
