To use dynamic imports in serverless functions, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a JavaScript file (`example.js`) that contains the code you want to dynamically import:
```javascript
// example.js
export function doSomething() {
  console.log("Doing something...");
}
```

2. In your serverless function file, use the `import()` function to dynamically import the module:
```javascript
// serverless.js
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  const { doSomething } = await import('./example.js');
  doSomething();
  
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "Dynamic import successful!",
  };
};
```

In the example above, the `import()` function, when called, returns a Promise. `await import('./example.js')` waits for the dynamically imported module to resolve, and then you can access the exported functions or variables. In this case, we retrieved the `doSomething` function and invoked it.

It's important to note that dynamic imports may not be supported in certain environments or older browsers. To ensure compatibility, consider using a transpiler like Babel or checking the compatibility table on MDN Web Docs.

Using dynamic imports with serverless functions can enhance code modularity and flexibility. By loading modules on-demand, you can optimize the performance of your serverless applications.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
