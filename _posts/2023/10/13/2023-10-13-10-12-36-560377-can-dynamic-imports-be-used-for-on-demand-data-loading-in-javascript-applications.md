Dynamic imports are especially useful when dealing with large modules or modules that are rarely used. Instead of loading all the modules at once, you can load them dynamically when a specific condition is met or when a certain action is triggered.

To use dynamic imports, you need to use the `import()` function, which returns a promise that resolves to the module you want to import. You can then use `async/await` or `.then()` to handle the loaded module.

Here's an example of how you can use dynamic imports for on-demand data loading:

```javascript
// Import module dynamically when a button is clicked
button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const module = await import('./path/to/module.js');
  // Use the imported module
  module.someFunction();
});

// Import module dynamically when a condition is met
if (someCondition) {
  import('./path/to/module.js')
    .then(module => {
      // Use the imported module
      module.someFunction();
    });
}
```

By using dynamic imports, you can optimize the loading time of your application and load modules only when they are actually needed. This can improve the overall performance and user experience of your JavaScript applications.
