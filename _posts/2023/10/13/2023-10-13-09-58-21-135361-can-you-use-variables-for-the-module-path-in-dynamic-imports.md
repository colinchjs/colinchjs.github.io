To use variables for the module path, you need to construct the path as a string concatenation or template literal and then pass it to the `import()` function.

Here's an example:

```javascript
const moduleName = './myModule.js';

import(moduleName)
  .then((module) => {
    // Use the imported module
    module.myFunction();
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Dynamic import failed:', error);
  });
```

In the above example, the `moduleName` variable holds the path to the module you want to import. The `import()` function dynamically imports the module at runtime and returns a promise.

You can use the imported module as you would with a regular static import.

It's worth mentioning that the variable used in the module path can be any type, as long as it evaluates to a string representing a valid module path.

Dynamic imports are helpful when you want to conditionally load modules or load them on-demand. They provide flexibility and improve code performance by allowing the selective loading of modules.
