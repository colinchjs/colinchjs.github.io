When using dynamic imports in JavaScript, it is essential to provide a smooth user experience by incorporating loading indicators or progress bars. This helps users understand that the application is loading additional resources or modules.

## Why Use Dynamic Imports?

Dynamic imports allow developers to load JavaScript modules on-demand, rather than loading everything upfront. This can significantly improve the initial load time of an application, as only the required modules are fetched when needed.

## Implementing a Loading Indicator or Progress Bar

To add a loading indicator or progress bar when using dynamic imports, you can follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Create a component or section dedicated to rendering the loading indicator or progress bar.

```javascript
// LoadingIndicator.js

import React from 'react';

const LoadingIndicator = () => {
  return (
    // HTML/CSS for your loading indicator or progress bar
    // e.g., a spinning animation or progress bar
    <div className="loading-indicator">
      Loading...
  </div>
  );
}

export default LoadingIndicator;
```

**Step 2:** Wrap your dynamic imports with the loading indicator component.

```javascript
// App.js

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import LoadingIndicator from './LoadingIndicator';

const App = () => {
  const [module, setModule] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchModule = async () => {
      setModule(await import('./dynamicModule'));
    };

    fetchModule();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render the loading indicator until the module is loaded */}
      {!module ? <LoadingIndicator /> : (
        // Render the dynamic module once it is loaded
        <div>
          {/* Render the content from the dynamic module */}
          {module.default}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, we are using React to demonstrate the implementation, but the concept can be applied to any JavaScript framework or library. 

The `useState` hook is used to keep track of the loaded module, and the `useEffect` hook is responsible for fetching the module using the `import()` function. While the module is being loaded, the LoadingIndicator component is rendered. Once the module is loaded, the actual content from the module is rendered.

## Conclusion

Adding loading indicators or progress bars when using dynamic imports in JavaScript can greatly enhance the user experience. Users are provided with visual feedback, indicating that additional resources or modules are being loaded. By following the steps outlined above, you can seamlessly implement loading indicators and progress bars in your dynamic import workflow.
