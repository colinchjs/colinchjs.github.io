In JavaScript, you can dynamically import modules based on the available memory of the device. This can be useful in scenarios where you have different versions of a module, and you want to load the appropriate version based on the device's memory limitations.

To dynamically import modules in JavaScript, you can use the `import()` function, which returns a promise that resolves to the module's namespace object. This function allows you to import modules at runtime, rather than at the top-level of your script.

Here's an example of dynamically importing modules based on the device's available memory:

```javascript
const memoryLimit = window.performance.memory.jsHeapSizeLimit;
const moduleToLoad = memoryLimit < 512000000 ? './module-lite.js' : './module-full.js';

import(moduleToLoad)
  .then((module) => {
    // Use the imported module
    module.doSomething();
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In the above example, we first get the available memory limit of the device using the `jsHeapSizeLimit` property from the `window.performance.memory` object. We then set the `moduleToLoad` variable based on the memory limit condition.

Next, we use the `import()` function to dynamically import the module based on the `moduleToLoad` value. Once the module is loaded, the promise resolves, and we can use the imported module as needed.

By dynamically importing modules based on the device's available memory, you can optimize the performance and memory consumption of your JavaScript application.

Remember to check compatibility with different JavaScript versions and use appropriate polyfills or transpilers if necessary.
