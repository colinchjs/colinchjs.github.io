React, being a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, provides a robust error handling mechanism called error boundaries. Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree, log those errors, and display an error UI instead of crashing the entire application.

By default, React doesn't handle global errors or uncaught exceptions that may occur outside the component's lifecycle methods. However, error boundaries enable us to handle such errors at a global level and gracefully recover from them.

## Creating an error boundary component

To create an error boundary component in React, we need to define a class component with two lifecycle methods: `componentDidCatch` and `render`. The `componentDidCatch` method is responsible for catching the errors, while the `render` method defines the fallback UI to be displayed in case of an error.

Here's an example of an error boundary component:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      hasError: false,
    };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // Log the error to an error reporting service
    console.error("Error:", error);
    console.error("Error Info:", errorInfo);

    this.setState({ hasError: true });
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // Display the fallback UI
      return <h1>Oops! Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    // Render the child component tree
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

## Using the error boundary component

To use the error boundary component, we wrap the desired component(s) with the `<ErrorBoundary>` component. Any errors thrown by the wrapped components will be caught by the error boundary and an error UI will be displayed instead.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ErrorBoundary from './ErrorBoundary';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the above example, if any errors occur in the `MyComponent` component, the error boundary will catch those errors and display the fallback UI specified in its `render` method.

## Handling global errors

To handle global errors or uncaught exceptions in React, we can utilize the `window.onerror` event handler. By setting a global error handler, all unhandled JavaScript errors in the application, including those outside React components, can be caught and processed.

Here's an example of setting up a global error handler:

```javascript
window.onerror = (message, source, lineno, colno, error) => {
  // Log the error to an error reporting service
  console.error("Global Error:", error);

  // Display a custom error UI or perform any necessary error handling
  // ...

  // Return true to prevent the error from propagating further
  return true;
};
```

With the global error handler in place, any uncaught JavaScript errors will be intercepted, logged, and can be handled appropriately.

## Conclusion

By using error boundaries in React, we can effectively handle global errors and uncaught exceptions at the component level. Error boundaries provide a centralized way to catch and recover from errors, improving the overall reliability and user experience of the application. Remember to log any errors to an error reporting service for better debugging and monitoring.
