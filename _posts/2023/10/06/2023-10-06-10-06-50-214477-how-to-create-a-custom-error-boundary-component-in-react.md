React provides error boundaries as a way to capture errors that occur during rendering, in lifecycle methods, or in constructors of the whole tree below them, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application. While React provides a default error boundary, you can also create a custom error boundary component to have more control over the error handling and display.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to create a custom error boundary component in React.

## Step 1: Set up a new React project

To get started, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, use the following command to create a new React project:

```bash
npx create-react-app error-boundary-example
```

Next, navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd error-boundary-example
```

## Step 2: Create an ErrorBoundary component

In your project folder, create a new file called `ErrorBoundary.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      hasError: false,
      error: null,
    };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true, error };
  }

  render() {
    const { hasError } = this.state;
    const { fallbackComponent: FallbackComponent, children } = this.props;

    if (hasError) {
      return <FallbackComponent error={this.state.error} />;
    }

    return children;
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```

In the `ErrorBoundary` component, we define a state variable `hasError` to track if an error has occurred and an `error` variable to store the error object. We also implement the static method `getDerivedStateFromError` to update the state when an error is caught.

In the `render` method, we check if `hasError` is true. If it is, we render the `FallbackComponent` with the error object passed as a prop. Otherwise, we render the `children` of the `ErrorBoundary` component.

## Step 3: Implement the Error Boundary in your application

Now let's use the `ErrorBoundary` component in our application. Open the `src/App.js` file and update it as follows:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ErrorBoundary from './ErrorBoundary';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

const FallbackComponent = ({ error }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Oops! Something went wrong!</h1>
      <p>{error.toString()}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary fallbackComponent={FallbackComponent}>
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
        <MyComponent />
      </div>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the `App` component, we import the `ErrorBoundary` component and a custom `MyComponent`. We also define a `FallbackComponent` that will be displayed when an error occurs.

Wrap the components you want to be covered by the error boundary with the `ErrorBoundary` component and pass the `FallbackComponent` as a prop.

## Step 4: Test the Error Boundary

Start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Now, if you introduce an error in the `MyComponent` component or any of its child components, the `ErrorBoundary` component will catch the error and display the fallback UI, rendering the `FallbackComponent` we defined in the `App` component.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learned how to create a custom error boundary component in React. Error boundaries are a powerful tool for handling errors without crashing the entire application. With a custom error boundary component, you can create a more user-friendly error handling experience by providing a fallback UI. Utilize error boundaries in your React applications to handle errors gracefully and enhance user experience.
