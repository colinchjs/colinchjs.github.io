In React Native, error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log them, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole application. They are helpful in handling exceptions and preventing the app from becoming unresponsive or crashing. In this article, we will explore some common use cases where error boundaries can be used effectively in React Native applications.

## 1. Network Request Error Handling

When making network requests in a React Native application, there is always a chance of encountering errors such as network timeouts, server errors, or connectivity issues. Using an error boundary component around the component that handles the network request can help catch and gracefully handle these errors.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

class NetworkRequestComponent extends Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
    error: null,
  };

  componentDidCatch(error) {
    this.setState({ error });
  }

  fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const data = await response.json();
      this.setState({ data });
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');
    }
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    this.fetchData();
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.error) {
      // Fallback UI for network request error
      return <Text>Error: {this.state.error.message}</Text>;
    }

    if (!this.state.data) {
      // Fallback UI while loading data
      return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
    }

    // Display the fetched data
    return <Text>Data: {this.state.data}</Text>;
  }
}

export default NetworkRequestComponent;
```

## 2. Third-Party Library Integration

When integrating third-party libraries in a React Native application, there might be cases where the library throws unexpected errors that could crash the app. By wrapping the component that uses the third-party library with an error boundary, we can handle these errors gracefully and prevent the app from crashing.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import ThirdPartyLibrary from 'third-party-library';

class ThirdPartyIntegrationComponent extends Component {
  state = {
    libraryData: null,
    error: null,
  };

  componentDidCatch(error) {
    this.setState({ error });
  }

  fetchDataFromLibrary = () => {
    try {
      const libraryData = ThirdPartyLibrary.getData();
      this.setState({ libraryData });
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch data from library');
    }
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    this.fetchDataFromLibrary();
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.error) {
      // Fallback UI for library integration error
      return <Text>Error: {this.state.error.message}</Text>;
    }

    if (!this.state.libraryData) {
      // Fallback UI while loading data from library
      return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
    }

    // Display the data from library
    return <Text>Data: {this.state.libraryData}</Text>;
  }
}

export default ThirdPartyIntegrationComponent;
```

## Conclusion

Error boundaries in React Native applications are a powerful tool to handle errors and prevent crashes. They can be used in various scenarios, such as handling network request errors and third-party library integration. By using error boundaries effectively, we can provide a better user experience and ensure the stability of our React Native applications.
