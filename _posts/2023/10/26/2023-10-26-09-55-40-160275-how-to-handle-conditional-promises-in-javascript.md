Promises are an integral part of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. They allow us to handle operations that may take some time to complete, such as fetching data from an API or reading from a file. However, there are scenarios where we need to handle promises conditionally, based on certain conditions. In this blog post, we will explore different techniques to handle conditional promises in JavaScript.

## Introduction to Promises

Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They have three possible states: *pending*, *fulfilled*, or *rejected*. The `then()` method of a promise is used to handle the fulfillment, while the `catch()` method is used to handle any errors or rejections.

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

In the above example, we are fetching data from an API using the `fetch()` function. The returned promise is chained with `then()` to parse the response as JSON and log the data to the console. If there is an error, it is caught and logged using `catch()`.

## Handling Conditional Promises

There are multiple ways to handle conditional promises in JavaScript, depending on the specific requirements of your code.

### Using `if` statements

The simplest way to handle conditional promises is by using `if` statements. You can conditionally execute different promises based on a condition. 

```javascript
if (condition) {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
} else {
  // Perform another operation
}
```

In the above example, if the condition is true, the API call is made and the data is logged. Otherwise, you can perform another operation based on the condition.

### Using `Promise.all`

If you have multiple promises that need to be conditionally handled, you can use `Promise.all` to wait for all promises to resolve and then handle them collectively.

```javascript
const promises = [];

if (condition1) {
  promises.push(fetchPromise1);
}

if (condition2) {
  promises.push(fetchPromise2);
}

Promise.all(promises)
  .then(results => {
    // Handle the results
  })
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

In the above example, `Promise.all` is used to wait for all promises in the `promises` array to resolve. Then, the `then()` method is used to handle the results collectively. If any of the promises reject, the `catch()` method is called.

### Using `async/await`

Another approach to handling conditional promises is by using `async/await` syntax, which allows writing asynchronous code in a synchronous manner.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  if (condition) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  } else {
    // Perform another operation
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `fetchData()` function is an `async` function that uses `await` to wait for the resolution of promises. The code inside the `try` block is executed if the condition is true. If there is an error, it is caught and logged using `catch()`.

## Conclusion

Handling conditional promises in JavaScript can be done using various techniques, such as `if` statements, `Promise.all`, or `async/await`. Choose the approach that best fits your specific requirements and coding style. Promises provide a powerful mechanism for handling asynchronous operations, and mastering the techniques to handle them conditionally will significantly improve your JavaScript code.
