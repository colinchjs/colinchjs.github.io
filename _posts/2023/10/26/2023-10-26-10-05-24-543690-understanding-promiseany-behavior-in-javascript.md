Promises are a powerful tool in JavaScript used for handling asynchronous operations. Introduced in ES6, promises provide a cleaner way to write asynchronous code compared to traditional callbacks. 

In ES2021, a new addition was made to promises called `Promise.any()`. This method allows you to handle a collection of promises and returns a new promise that is fulfilled as soon as any of the input promises resolve successfully. In this article, we will dive into understanding the behavior of `Promise.any()`.

## Basic Usage

The basic syntax of `Promise.any()` is as follows:

```javascript
Promise.any(iterable)
  .then(result => {
    // handle the result
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // handle the error
  });
```

The `iterable` parameter represents an iterable collection of promises, such as an array. When `Promise.any()` is invoked, it returns a promise that is resolved as soon as any of the input promises are resolved. The resulting promise will contain the value of the first resolved promise.

## Resolving Values

`Promise.any()` behaves differently from `Promise.race()`, which returns the first resolved or rejected promise. With `Promise.any()`, even if one of the promises is rejected, the method will still resolve when the first promise is resolved.

```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'Promise 1');
});

const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 200, 'Promise 2');
});

const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 300, 'Promise 3');
});

Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result); // Output: Promise 1
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // This block won't be executed as at least one promise resolved successfully
  });
```

In the example above, `Promise.any()` is used to handle an array of three promises. Even though `promise2` and `promise3` have a longer delay, the method resolves with the value from `promise1`, as it resolves earlier.

## Handling Errors

If all of the input promises are rejected, `Promise.any()` will reject with an `AggregateError` containing all the rejection reasons. This behavior is different from `Promise.race()`, which only returns the rejection reason of the first rejected promise.

```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(reject, 100, 'Promise 1 rejected');
});

const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(reject, 200, 'Promise 2 rejected');
});

const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(reject, 300, 'Promise 3 rejected');
});

Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then(result => {
    // This block won't be executed as at least one promise needs to resolve
  })
  .catch(errors => {
    console.log(errors); 
    // Output: AggregateError: All promises were rejected
    // Contains all the rejection reasons in an array
  });
```

In the above example, none of the promises resolve successfully, so `Promise.any()` rejects with an `AggregateError` containing the reasons for rejection from all the promises.

## Browser Support

It's important to note that `Promise.any()` is not supported in all browsers. As of July 2021, it is supported by Chrome, Firefox, and Safari but not by Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge. To use `Promise.any()` in unsupported environments, you can consider using a polyfill like `promise-any`.

## Conclusion

`Promise.any()` provides a convenient way to handle a collection of promises and retrieve the value of the first resolved promise. However, keep in mind that it behaves differently from `Promise.race()` and returns an `AggregateError` when all the input promises are rejected. Understanding the behavior of `Promise.any()` allows you to write more efficient and reliable asynchronous code in JavaScript.
