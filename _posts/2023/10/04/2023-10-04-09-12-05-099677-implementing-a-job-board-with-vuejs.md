## Introduction

A job board is a platform that displays job listings from employers or recruiters. Users can explore and apply for available job opportunities. 

## Getting Started

To begin, let's set up a new Vue.js project. If you haven't already installed the Vue CLI, you can do so using the following command:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Once the Vue CLI is installed, you can use it to create a new project:

```
vue create job-board
```

After the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd job-board
```

## Creating the Job Board Component

Inside the `src/components` directory, create a new file called `JobBoard.vue`. This component will serve as the main container for the job board functionality.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Job board UI goes here -->
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'JobBoard',
  data() {
    return {
      jobListings: []
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // Fetch job listings here
  }
}
</script>

<style>
/* CSS styles for job board component */
</style>
```

## Fetching Job Listings

To fetch job listings, we'll make use of the `axios` library. Install it using the following command:

```
npm install axios
```

In the `JobBoard.vue` component, import `axios` and update the `mounted` hook to fetch job listings from an API:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Job board UI goes here -->
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
  name: 'JobBoard',
  data() {
    return {
      jobListings: []
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    axios.get('/api/jobs')
      .then(response => {
        this.jobListings = response.data;
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
      });
  }
}
</script>
```

Make sure to replace `'/api/jobs'` with the appropriate API endpoint for fetching job listings.

## Filtering and Sorting Job Listings

To make it easier for users to find relevant job listings, we can implement filtering and sorting functionality. We can add a form with various filter options, and update the `jobListings` data property based on the selected filters.

## Displaying Job Details

When a user clicks on a job listing, we can display the details of that specific job in a separate component. To implement this, create a new component called `JobDetails.vue`.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Job details UI goes here -->
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'JobDetails',
  props: {
    job: Object
  }
}
</script>

<style>
/* CSS styles for job details component */
</style>
```

In the `JobBoard.vue` component, import the `JobDetails` component and add the necessary code to display the selected job details when a job listing is clicked.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Job board UI goes here -->
    <job-details v-if="selectedJob" :job="selectedJob" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import JobDetails from './JobDetails.vue';

export default {
  name: 'JobBoard',
  components: {
    JobDetails
  },
  data() {
    return {
      jobListings: [],
      selectedJob: null
    }
  },
  methods: {
    showJobDetails(job) {
      this.selectedJob = job;
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
