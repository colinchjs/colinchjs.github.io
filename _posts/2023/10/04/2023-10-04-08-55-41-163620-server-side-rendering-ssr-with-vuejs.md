Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique that allows the server to render the initial HTML content of a web page instead of relying on the client-side JavaScript to render it. This approach offers several benefits such as improved performance, better search engine optimization (SEO), and enhanced user experience.

Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, provides excellent support for server-side rendering. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement server-side rendering with Vue.js and leverage its benefits.

## Why use SSR with Vue.js?

Server-side rendering with Vue.js can provide many advantages for your web application:

### 1. Improved performance

With SSR, the initial page load is faster as the server sends back fully rendered HTML to the client. This reduces the time required for client-side JavaScript to fetch data and render the page. SSR also helps to reduce the time to interactive (TTI) metrics, resulting in a smoother and more responsive user experience.

### 2. Better SEO

Search engine crawlers have difficulty interpreting JavaScript-heavy web pages. With SSR, the server sends fully rendered HTML to the search engines, making it easier for them to crawl and index your content. This can significantly improve your website's visibility and search engine rankings.

## Implementing SSR with Vue.js

To implement server-side rendering with Vue.js, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Vue CLI

First, make sure you have Vue CLI installed. If you don't have it, you can install it globally by running the following command:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

### 2. Create a new project

Next, create a new Vue.js project using the Vue CLI. Run the following command and follow the prompts:

```
vue create my-ssr-app
```

### 3. Add server-side rendering support

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory and add server-side rendering support with the following command:

```
vue add @vue/server-renderer
```

### 4. Update the entry point

In your project's `src` directory, you will find `main.js`, which serves as the entry point for your application. Update it to support server-side rendering by modifying the code as follows:

```javascript
import { createApp } from './main'
import { renderToString } from '@vue/server-renderer'

export default async context => {
  const { app } = createApp()

  // Render the app to string
  const appHtml = await renderToString(app, context)

  return `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head></head>
      <body>
        <div id="app">${appHtml}</div>
        <script src="/dist/js/chunk-vendors.js"></script>
        <script src="/dist/js/app.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
  `
}
```

### 5. Build for production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

### 6. Start the server

Finally, start the server and enjoy the benefits of server-side rendering! Run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

## Conclusion

Server-side rendering with Vue.js can greatly enhance the performance, SEO, and user experience of your web application. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily implement SSR with Vue.js and reap the benefits it brings.

Start leveraging the power of server-side rendering with Vue.js and take your web application to the next level!
