## Introduction

Social media sharing has become an essential feature for modern websites. It allows users to share interesting content with their friends and followers, increasing the reach and visibility of the website. With Vue.js, we can easily create reusable components to integrate social media sharing functionality into our projects.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

- Basic understanding of Vue.js
- Vue CLI installed globally
- A text editor of your choice

## Setting up the Project

Start by creating a new Vue project using the Vue CLI.

```bash
vue create social-media-sharing-component
cd social-media-sharing-component
```

Once the project is created, navigate to the project folder and open it in your text editor.

## Creating the Social Media Sharing Component

In the `src/components` folder, create a new file named `SocialMediaSharing.vue`. This file will contain the code for our social media sharing component.

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="shareToFacebook">Share on Facebook</button>
    <button @click="shareToTwitter">Share on Twitter</button>
    <button @click="shareToLinkedIn">Share on LinkedIn</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    shareToFacebook() {
      // Add code to share content on Facebook
    },
    shareToTwitter() {
      // Add code to share content on Twitter
    },
    shareToLinkedIn() {
      // Add code to share content on LinkedIn
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

In the code above, we have created a simple component with three buttons for sharing content on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. We have defined three methods: `shareToFacebook()`, `shareToTwitter()`, and `shareToLinkedIn()`, where you can add the respective code to actually share the content on each platform.

## Displaying the Share Buttons

To use our social media sharing component, open the `App.vue` file in the `src` folder and add the following code:

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <social-media-sharing></social-media-sharing>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import SocialMediaSharing from './components/SocialMediaSharing.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    SocialMediaSharing
  }
}
</script>
```

Here, we have imported and registered our `SocialMediaSharing` component and added it to the template. Now, when you run the project, you should see the share buttons on your web page.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to build a social media sharing component using Vue.js. We created a simple component with buttons to share content on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. You can further enhance this component by adding the necessary code to actually share the content on each platform.
