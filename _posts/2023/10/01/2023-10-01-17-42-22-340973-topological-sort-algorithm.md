The topological sort algorithm is used to order the vertices of a directed graph in such a way that for every directed edge 𝑢 → 𝑣, vertex 𝑢 comes before vertex 𝑣 in the ordering. This algorithm is commonly used in various applications like scheduling, task management, and dependency resolution.

## Understanding Topological Sort

To understand the topological sort algorithm, let's consider a directed graph represented as a set of vertices and edges. Each vertex represents a task, and the directed edges represent dependencies between tasks.

The steps involved in the topological sort algorithm are as follows:

1. Identify a vertex with no incoming edges (in-degree equals 0) and add it to the result.
2. Remove the identified vertex and its outgoing edges from the graph.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all vertices have been identified and added to the result.

## Example of Topological Sort

Let's consider a simple example to demonstrate the topological sort algorithm. Assume we have a set of tasks and their dependencies represented in a directed graph:

```
Tasks: A, B, C, D, E, F
Dependencies: A → B, A → C, B → D, C → E, D → F, E → F
```

The topological sort algorithm will produce the following ordering:

```
A → C → E → B → D → F
```

In this ordering, each task is positioned after its dependencies. For example, task A is positioned before tasks B and C, as they directly depend on it.

## Implementing Topological Sort Algorithm

To implement the topological sort algorithm in a programming language like Python, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Here is an example implementation using Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def topologicalSort(graph):
    visited = set()
    stack = []

    def dfs(node):
        nonlocal visited
        
        visited.add(node)

        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)

        stack.append(node)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)

    return stack[::-1]
```

In this implementation, we first create a graph using an adjacency list representation, where each vertex is mapped to its outgoing edges. Then, we perform a depth-first search starting from each unvisited vertex. The visited vertices are stored in a stack, and the final ordering is obtained by reversing the stack.

## Conclusion

The topological sort algorithm is an important algorithm used in various applications where ordering based on dependencies is required. By following the steps of the algorithm, we can obtain a valid and consistent ordering of the vertices in a directed graph.
