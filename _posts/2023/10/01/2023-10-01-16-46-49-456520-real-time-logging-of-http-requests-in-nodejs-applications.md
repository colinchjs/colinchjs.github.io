Logging is an essential part of any application, helping developers gain insights into the behavior and performance of their code. When it comes to Node.js applications, logging HTTP requests is particularly important as it allows us to monitor the flow of data and diagnose any potential issues.

In this article, we will explore how to implement real-time logging of HTTP requests in Node.js applications. We will leverage the power of popular logging libraries like Winston and Morgan to capture and log the incoming requests.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine

## Setting up a basic Node.js application
First, let's create a basic Node.js application structure. Open your terminal and follow the steps below:

1. Create a new directory for your application and navigate into it:
   ```shell
   $ mkdir http-logger
   $ cd http-logger
   ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```shell
   $ npm init -y
   ```

3. Create an `index.js` file and open it in your preferred code editor.

## Installing required packages
Now that we have set up our basic application, let's install the required packages:

1. Install the `express` package to create a server:
   ```shell
   $ npm install express
   ```

2. Install the `morgan` and `winston` packages for logging:
   ```shell
   $ npm install morgan winston
   ```

## Implementing real-time logging
With the packages installed, let's implement real-time logging of HTTP requests in our Node.js application.

1. Import the required modules and create an instance of Express:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const morgan = require('morgan');
   const winston = require('winston');
   
   const app = express();
   ```

2. Create a custom logger using Winston and configure it to write logs to the console:
   ```javascript
   const logger = winston.createLogger({
     transports: [
       new winston.transports.Console()
     ]
   });
   ```

3. Add the `morgan` middleware to your Express application to capture HTTP request logs:
   ```javascript
   app.use(morgan('combined', {
     stream: {
       write: (message) => logger.info(message.trim())
     }
   }));
   ```

4. Define a basic route to test the logging:
   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, world!');
   });
   ```

5. Start the server and listen on a specific port:
   ```javascript
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

## Testing the application
To test the logging functionality, start the Node.js application by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
$ node index.js
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser and observe the logs in the console. You should see each HTTP request being logged in real-time.

## Conclusion
Implementing real-time logging of HTTP requests in Node.js applications is crucial for monitoring and debugging purposes. By using logging libraries like Winston and Morgan, we can easily capture and log the incoming requests. This helps us gain valuable insights into the behavior of our applications, enabling us to identify and fix any issues quickly.
