Log4js is a popular logging framework for Node.js applications, which allows you to generate and control logs in your application. While Log4js provides default logging capabilities, it also offers a real-time logging feature that allows you to view logs as they are being generated.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement real-time logging using Log4js in Node.js.

## Installation

First, we need to install the Log4js package using npm:

```shell
$ npm install log4js
```
## Setting up Log4js

After installing Log4js, we can create a file called `logger.js` where we will define our logging configuration. 

```javascript
// logger.js
const log4js = require('log4js');

log4js.configure({
  appenders: {
    console: { type: 'console' },
    file: { type: 'file', filename: 'logs/all.log' }
  },
  categories: {
    default: { appenders: ['console', 'file'], level: 'debug' }
  }
});

const logger = log4js.getLogger();

module.exports = logger;
```

In the configuration above, we define two appenders: 'console' and 'file'. The 'console' appender allows logs to be displayed in the console, while the 'file' appender writes logs to a file named `all.log`. We also specify the logging level as 'debug', which means it will log all levels from 'debug' to 'fatal'.

## Logging in real-time

To implement real-time logging, we can use the concept of event listeners in Node.js. We will create a separate file called `app.js` where we will listen for events such as log messages and log events.

```javascript
// app.js
const logger = require('./logger');

logger.on('log', (log) => {
  console.log(`New log: ${log}`);
});

logger.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
});

logger.debug('This is a debug message');
logger.error('This is an error message');
```

In the above code, the `logger.on('log')` event listener will trigger whenever a log message is being generated. Inside the event listener callback, we can perform any custom logic, such as displaying the log message in real-time.

Similarly, the `logger.on('error')` event listener will trigger when an error occurs during logging. Inside the event listener callback, we can handle the error accordingly.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement real-time logging using Log4js in a Node.js application. By leveraging the event listeners functionality in Node.js, we can easily track and display log messages as they occur.

Real-time logging can be invaluable for debugging and monitoring applications, allowing developers to quickly identify issues and resolve them promptly.
