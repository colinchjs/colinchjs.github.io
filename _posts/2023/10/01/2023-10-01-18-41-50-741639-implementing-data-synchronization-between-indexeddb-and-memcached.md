In modern web applications, it's common to use multiple data storage mechanisms to optimize performance and maintain data consistency. IndexedDB and Memcached are two popular storage solutions that are often used together in a web application stack. IndexedDB serves as a client-side persistence layer, while Memcached acts as a distributed caching system.

To ensure data synchronization between IndexedDB and Memcached, we can follow a simple approach that involves capturing events from IndexedDB and propagating the changes to Memcached.

## Setting Up IndexedDB

First, let's set up IndexedDB in our web application. We'll assume that IndexedDB is already initialized and accessible through the `indexedDB` global object.

```javascript
const databaseName = 'myDatabase';
const objectStoreName = 'myObjectStore';

// Open a connection to the IndexedDB database
const request = indexedDB.open(databaseName, 1);

// Create or upgrade database schema
request.onupgradeneeded = (event) => {
  const db = event.target.result;
  db.createObjectStore(objectStoreName, { keyPath: 'id' });
};

// Handle errors and success
request.onerror = (event) => {
  console.error('Failed to open IndexedDB.');
};

request.onsuccess = (event) => {
  const db = event.target.result;
  
  // Listen to changes in the database
  db.addEventListener('versionchange', (event) => {
    // Handle version change event
  });
};
```

## Synchronizing with Memcached

To synchronize data between IndexedDB and Memcached, we can use a pub/sub mechanism. Here, we'll use Redis Pub/Sub as an example.

1. Whenever there is a data change in IndexedDB, publish a message with the updated data to a Redis Pub/Sub channel.
2. On the Memcached side, subscribe to the Redis channel and receive the published messages.
3. Update the corresponding data in Memcached.

Here's an example code snippet for the IndexedDB side:

```javascript
// Update data in IndexedDB
function updateDataInIndexedDB(data) {
  const transaction = db.transaction([objectStoreName], 'readwrite');
  const objectStore = transaction.objectStore(objectStoreName);
  
  // Update data using put method
  const request = objectStore.put(data);

  request.onsuccess = (event) => {
    // Publish the updated data to Redis channel
    const updatedData = event.target.result;
    publishToRedis(updatedData);
  };

  request.onerror = (event) => {
    console.error('Failed to update data in IndexedDB.');
  };
}

// Publish updated data to Redis channel
function publishToRedis(data) {
  // Implement Redis client and publish the data to the channel
}
```

On the Memcached side, we can subscribe to the Redis channel and update the data accordingly. The implementation depends on the programming language and framework being used.

By implementing this synchronization mechanism between IndexedDB and Memcached, you can ensure that your data remains consistent across both storage systems. This approach can be customized to fit specific application requirements and extended to handle complex data synchronization scenarios.
