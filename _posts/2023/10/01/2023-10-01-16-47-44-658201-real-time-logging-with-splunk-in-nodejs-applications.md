## Introduction
In modern application development, real-time logging is crucial for effectively monitoring and troubleshooting applications. One popular tool for log analysis is Splunk, which provides powerful features for searching, analyzing, and visualizing log data. In this blog post, we will explore how to integrate Splunk with Node.js applications to achieve real-time logging.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- A Splunk account with sufficient privileges to create and configure inputs
- Node.js installed on your machine

## Setup Splunk
1. Log in to your Splunk account and navigate to the **Settings** page.
2. Under the **Data** section, click on **Forwarding and receiving**.
3. Click **Add new** under **Receive data**, and specify the port on which your Splunk instance will receive logs.
4. Click **Review** and then **Restart Splunk** to apply the changes.

## Integrating Splunk in Node.js
1. Open your Node.js application project in your code editor.
2. Install the Splunk logging library by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install splunk-logging
```

3. Create a new file named `splunk-logger.js` in your project and add the following code:

```javascript
const SplunkLogger = require("splunk-logging");

// Configure Splunk connection parameters
const config = {
    token: "YOUR_SPLUNK_TOKEN",
    url: "YOUR_SPLUNK_HOST",
    port: 8088,
};

// Create a new Splunk logger instance
const logger = new SplunkLogger(config);

// Enable SSL
logger.requestOptions.protocol = "https";

// Enable JSON formatting
logger.eventFormatter = (message) => {
    return JSON.stringify(message);
};

// Log function
const log = (level, message) => {
    const event = {
        message,
        level,
    };
    logger.send(event, (error, response, body) => {
        if (error) {
            console.error("Error logging to Splunk:", error);
        }
    });
};

module.exports = log;
```

4. Replace `YOUR_SPLUNK_TOKEN` and `YOUR_SPLUNK_HOST` in the `config` object with your Splunk token and host.
5. Import the `log` function in your Node.js application files where you want to log events.

## Logging events in your Node.js application
Now that we have set up the Splunk logger, let's see how to use it in your Node.js application.

```javascript
const log = require("./splunk-logger");

// Logging an informational message
log("info", "Application started");

// Logging an error message
log("error", "An error occurred");

// Logging a warning message
log("warn", "Please check your input");

...
```

With this integration, your application logs will be sent in real-time to your Splunk instance for analysis and monitoring.

## Conclusion
Real-time logging is essential for effective application monitoring and troubleshooting. By integrating Splunk with your Node.js applications, you can gain valuable insights from log data. In this blog post, we explored how to set up and use the Splunk logging library to achieve real-time logging in Node.js applications. Start leveraging the power of Splunk to enhance your application's monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities.
