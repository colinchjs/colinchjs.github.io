IndexedDB is a powerful client-side storage API provided by modern browsers. It allows web applications to store and retrieve large amounts of structured data. While IndexedDB offers a lot of features and benefits, there are some limitations that developers should be aware of.

### 1. Asynchronous Nature:
IndexedDB is inherently asynchronous, meaning that all operations are non-blocking and executed in separate transactions. This can make the code more complex and harder to manage, especially when dealing with multiple transactions and dependencies.

### 2. Lack of Built-in Query Language:
Unlike traditional databases, IndexedDB does not provide a built-in query language like SQL. In IndexedDB, you need to manually write code to filter and query data based on your requirements, which can be more time-consuming and error-prone.

### 3. Limited Cross-Browser Compatibility:
While IndexedDB is supported by most modern browsers, there can still be differences in implementation and browser-specific bugs. This can cause compatibility issues and require additional workarounds for different browsers.

### 4. Size Limitations:
IndexedDB has storage limitations that vary across browsers. In some cases, the maximum storage size for IndexedDB can be as low as a few megabytes. This can be a challenge for applications that require storing large amounts of data.

### 5. No Native Encryption:
IndexedDB does not provide native encryption support. If your application requires secure storage of sensitive data, you need to implement encryption techniques manually. This adds complexity and potentially increases the risk of data breaches if not implemented correctly.

### 6. Lack of Transaction Isolation:
IndexedDB does not offer full transaction isolation. When multiple transactions are running concurrently, changes made by one transaction may be visible to other transactions before committing. This can lead to data consistency issues if not carefully managed.

### 7. Limited Mobile Support:
While IndexedDB is widely supported on desktop browsers, its support on mobile browsers can be limited. Some mobile browsers may have incomplete or non-standard implementations, making it challenging to build cross-platform applications.

### 8. Steep Learning Curve:
IndexedDB has a complex API and can be challenging for developers who are not familiar with it. Understanding the concepts of databases, object stores, indexes, and transactions requires a learning curve that may slow down development initially.

While IndexedDB has its limitations, it is still a powerful tool for managing client-side storage in web applications. By understanding these limitations and working around them, developers can effectively leverage the capabilities of IndexedDB. #IndexedDB #webdevelopment
