In any Node.js application, logging is an important aspect for understanding the flow of execution and diagnosing issues. One popular logging library in Node.js is Bunyan, which provides a simple and extensible way to add logging to your application.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement real-time logging using Bunyan in a Node.js application.

### Step 1: Installing Bunyan

To use Bunyan in your Node.js project, you need to install it as a dependency. Open your terminal and navigate to your project's root directory, then run the following command:

```bash
npm install bunyan
```

### Step 2: Creating a Logger instance

Once Bunyan is installed, you can create a logger instance in your code. Import the `bunyan` module and use it to create a logger object, like this:

```javascript
const bunyan = require('bunyan');

const logger = bunyan.createLogger({
  name: 'my-app',
  level: 'info',
});
```

Here, we are creating a logger named 'my-app' with the log level set to 'info'. You can configure the logger with various options, such as setting a custom log format, specifying output streams, and defining serializers. Refer to the [Bunyan documentation](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) for detailed configuration options.

### Step 3: Logging messages

Once you have created the logger instance, you can use it to log messages at different levels. Here's an example of logging a message at the 'info' level:

```javascript
logger.info('This is an info message');
```

You can log messages at different levels, such as 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error', etc. The log level determines which messages are actually logged. Messages below the specified log level will be ignored.

### Step 4: Streaming logs in real-time

By default, Bunyan logs to the console. However, in real-world scenarios, you may want to send the logs to a file or stream them to a centralized logging service.

To stream logs in real-time, you can use the `bunyan-log-stream` module. Install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install bunyan-log-stream
```

Once installed, you can create a writable stream and pipe it to the Bunyan logger, like this:

```javascript
const logStream = require('bunyan-log-stream');

const outputStream = logStream({ path: '/path/to/logfile.log' });
logger.streams.push({
  level: 'info',
  type: 'raw',
  stream: outputStream,
});
```

Here, we are creating a writable stream that writes logs to the specified file. We then add it to the logger's streams so that logs of level 'info' are also sent to the output stream.

### Conclusion

Implementing real-time logging with Bunyan in Node.js is a straightforward process. By following the steps in this tutorial, you can easily set up a logger in your Node.js application and stream logs in real-time to a file or external service. This helps you monitor and troubleshoot your application effectively.
