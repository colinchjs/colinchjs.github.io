In modern web applications, it is common to have offline capabilities where users can interact with data even when they are not connected to the internet. IndexedDB is a powerful client-side database that allows you to store and query data within the browser. On the other hand, Apache Ignite is an in-memory computing platform that provides distributed caching and data processing capabilities. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement data synchronization between IndexedDB and Apache Ignite, ensuring that data stays consistent and up-to-date across both systems.

## Why Synchronize IndexedDB with Apache Ignite?

Synchronizing data between IndexedDB and Apache Ignite offers several benefits:

1. **Offline Capabilities**: With IndexedDB, users can work with data even when they are offline. When they come back online, the changes made locally can be automatically synchronized with Apache Ignite.

2. **Scalability**: Apache Ignite is designed to handle large amounts of data and provide high performance. By synchronizing with IndexedDB, you can leverage the power of Apache Ignite for processing and analyzing data.

3. **Consistency**: Synchronizing data ensures that changes made in one system are propagated to the other, maintaining data consistency across both IndexedDB and Apache Ignite.

## Step 1: Storing Data in IndexedDB

To get started, we need to store data in IndexedDB whenever changes are made by the user. Here is an example of how you can store data in IndexedDB using JavaScript:

```javascript
const dbName = "myDb";
const storeName = "myStore";

// Open a connection to the database
const request = window.indexedDB.open(dbName, 1);

// Create the object store
request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  const db = event.target.result;
  db.createObjectStore(storeName, { keyPath: 'id' });
};

// Save data to IndexedDB
request.onsuccess = function(event) {
  const db = event.target.result;
  const transaction = db.transaction(storeName, 'readwrite');
  const store = transaction.objectStore(storeName);

  // Example data to be stored
  const data = { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 25 };

  // Add the data to the store
  const addRequest = store.add(data);
};
```

## Step 2: Synchronizing with Apache Ignite

Once the data is stored in IndexedDB, we need to synchronize it with Apache Ignite. Apache Ignite provides various connectors to integrate with different databases. Here, we will use the Apache Ignite REST API to insert or update the data.

```javascript
const igniteUrl = "http://localhost:8080/ignite";
const cacheName = "myCache";
const apiKey = "your_api_key";

// Synchronize data with Apache Ignite
fetch(`${igniteUrl}/v1/caches/${cacheName}`, {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-API-Key": apiKey
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data) // data from IndexedDB
})
.then(response => {
  if (response.ok) {
    console.log("Data synchronized with Apache Ignite");
  }
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error("Error synchronizing data:", error);
});
```

Ensure that the Apache Ignite REST API endpoint, cache name, and API key are properly configured to match your environment.

## Step 3: Handling Synchronization Conflicts

During synchronization, conflicts may arise when the same data is modified in both IndexedDB and Apache Ignite. To handle conflicts, you can implement conflict resolution strategies such as "last write wins" or merging changes.

For example, if you want the changes made in IndexedDB to override Apache Ignite's data, you can modify the Apache Ignite synchronization step as follows:

```javascript
fetch(`${igniteUrl}/v1/caches/${cacheName}/${data.id}`, {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-API-Key": apiKey
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data) // data from IndexedDB
})
```

## Conclusion

By implementing data synchronization between IndexedDB and Apache Ignite, you can provide offline capabilities, scalability, and data consistency in your web applications. Storing data in IndexedDB and synchronizing it with Apache Ignite allows you to leverage the power of distributed caching and data processing, enhancing the overall performance and responsiveness of your application.

With proper handling of synchronization conflicts, you can ensure that data remains consistent across both systems. Start exploring this powerful combination of technologies and unlock new possibilities for your web applications.
