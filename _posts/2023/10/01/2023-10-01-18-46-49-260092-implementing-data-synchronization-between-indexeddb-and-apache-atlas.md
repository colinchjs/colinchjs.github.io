With the increasing popularity of offline web applications, the need for data synchronization between client-side storage and server-side databases has become more critical. IndexedDB is a powerful client-side storage solution that allows web applications to store large amounts of structured data, while Apache Atlas is a comprehensive metadata management and data governance framework.

In this blog post, we will explore the process of implementing data synchronization between IndexedDB and Apache Atlas, enabling seamless data exchange and consistency between client and server.

## Introduction

IndexedDB is a NoSQL database built into modern web browsers, providing a key-value store with rich querying capabilities. It offers an efficient and flexible way to store and retrieve structured data on the client-side. On the other hand, Apache Atlas is a widely adopted metadata management and governance solution in the Big Data ecosystem. It allows organizations to define, manage, and govern their data assets effectively.

## Synchronization Process

To implement data synchronization between IndexedDB and Apache Atlas, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Capture Changes**: In the IndexedDB database, we listen for any changes made to the data. This could include insertions, updates, or deletions. We can use the browser's IndexedDB API to capture these changes.

2. **Serialize Data**: Once changes are captured, we need to convert the data into a serialized format suitable for transferring over network protocols. JSON is a commonly used format for this purpose. We can leverage JavaScript's built-in JSON.stringify() method to serialize our data.

3. **Send Data to Apache Atlas**: The next step involves sending the serialized data to Apache Atlas over a network protocol. This can be accomplished by making HTTP requests from the client-side application to the Apache Atlas REST API. 
Here's an example of sending JSON data using JavaScript:

```javascript
const data = { 
  // Serialized data
};

fetch('https://your-apache-atlas-api-endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
})
.then(response => {
  // Handle response from Apache Atlas
})
.catch(error => {
  // Handle error
});
```

4. **Process Data in Apache Atlas**: Once Apache Atlas receives the synchronized data, you can process it according to your needs. This may involve validating the data, performing additional transformations, or updating your metadata models.

5. **Track Sync Status**: It is essential to keep track of the synchronization status between IndexedDB and Apache Atlas. This can be done by maintaining a sync timestamp or a version number. By comparing this information on subsequent sync operations, you can identify which data needs to be synchronized.

## Conclusion

Implementing data synchronization between IndexedDB and Apache Atlas allows you to leverage the power of a client-side database while ensuring data consistency and governance. By following the steps outlined in this post, you can enable seamless data exchange between your web application and Apache Atlas, empowering your organization to manage and govern its data effectively.
