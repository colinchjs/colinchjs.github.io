When analyzing the time complexity of depth first traversal (DFS) algorithms, there are a few factors to consider, such as the size of the input graph and the implementation approach.

## Recursive DFS

Recursive DFS is a popular approach to perform depth first traversal. In this approach, the algorithm recursively explores each neighbor of a vertex before backtracking.

The time complexity of recursive DFS can be represented as O(V + E), where V represents the number of vertices and E represents the number of edges in the graph. This complexity arises because, in the worst case, the algorithm may visit each vertex and edge once.

## Iterative DFS

While recursive DFS is intuitive, it could lead to stack overflow errors when dealing with large graphs. Iterative DFS, on the other hand, uses an explicit stack to avoid excessive function calls.

The time complexity of iterative DFS is also O(V + E) because it visits each vertex and edge once.

## Comparison to Breadth First Traversal

DFS and breadth first traversal (BFS) are two popular graph traversal algorithms. While the time complexities of both algorithms are the same, they differ in their traversal strategies. DFS explores the graph in a depth-first manner, whereas BFS explores the graph level by level.

## Conclusion

In summary, the time complexity of depth first traversal (both recursive and iterative approaches) is O(V + E). This analysis assumes that the graph is represented using adjacency lists or matrices. It's important to note that the time complexity may vary depending on the specific implementation and the data structures used to represent the graph.
