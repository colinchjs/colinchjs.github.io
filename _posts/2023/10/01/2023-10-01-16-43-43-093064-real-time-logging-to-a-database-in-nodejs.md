## Setting Up MongoDB

Before we begin, make sure you have MongoDB installed on your machine or have access to a MongoDB instance. You can download MongoDB from the official website [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download).

Once MongoDB is installed, start the MongoDB server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mongod
```

Now, let's create a new Node.js project and install the necessary packages.

## Project Setup

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir logging-project
cd logging-project
```

Initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Next, install the required dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm install express mongoose dotenv morgan
```

The packages we installed are:
- `express` - for creating the Node.js server
- `mongoose` - for connecting to MongoDB and interacting with the database
- `dotenv` - for securely managing environment variables
- `morgan` - for HTTP request logging

Now that the project setup is complete, let's move on to the code implementation.

## Implementing Real-time Logging

First, create a new file called `index.js` in the project root directory:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const morgan = require('morgan');

// Load environment variables from .env file
require('dotenv').config();

// Create an Express app
const app = express();

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
})
  .then(() => console.log('Connected to MongoDB'))
  .catch((err) => console.error('Failed to connect to MongoDB:', err.message));

// Middleware for HTTP request logging
app.use(morgan('combined'));

// Define routes
// ...

// Start the server
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

The above code sets up an Express application, connects to the MongoDB database, and includes the `morgan` middleware to log incoming HTTP requests.

To use environment variables securely, we load them from a `.env` file using `dotenv`. Make sure to create a `.env` file in your project directory and add the following line, replacing `<YOUR_MONGODB_URI>` with your MongoDB connection string:

```
MONGODB_URI=<YOUR_MONGODB_URI>
```

You can obtain the MongoDB connection string from your MongoDB Atlas dashboard or if you are using a local instance, it will be `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

Feel free to define your own routes and log specific events or error messages within those routes using `console.log`, `console.error`, or other logging methods provided by Node.js.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to implement real-time logging to a MongoDB database in a Node.js application. By leveraging the power of MongoDB and the ease of development with Node.js, developers can efficiently track and troubleshoot their applications.

Remember to analyze and monitor the logs regularly to gain insights and improve the performance of your application. Happy logging!
