Kruskal's algorithm is a popular algorithm in graph theory used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, weighted graph. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at the time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm.

## Introduction to Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds the minimum spanning tree by adding edges from the original graph in ascending order of their weights. It ensures that adding any new edge to the growing minimum spanning tree does not form a cycle.

## Time Complexity Analysis

To analyze the time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm, we need to consider the major operations that the algorithm performs:

1. **Sorting of Edges**: The first step in Kruskal's algorithm is to sort the edges of the graph based on their weights. Typically, a sorting algorithm like QuickSort or MergeSort is used for this purpose. The time complexity of these sorting algorithms is O(E log E), where E represents the number of edges in the graph.

2. **Disjoint Set Operations**: Kruskal's algorithm utilizes disjoint set data structure to check if two vertices belong to the same connected component or not. The disjoint set operations, including find and union, have a time complexity of O(log V), where V represents the number of vertices in the graph.

3. **Edge Selection and Addition**: For each edge in the sorted order, Kruskal's algorithm checks if adding the edge to the minimum spanning tree forms a cycle or not. This check involves using the disjoint set data structure, which has a time complexity of O(log V) per edge. Since there are E edges in total, the total time complexity for this step becomes O(E log V).

Adding up the time complexities for each step, we get O(E log E) + O(E log V). However, in most cases, the number of edges is much larger than the number of vertices (E >> V). Therefore, we can simplify the expression to O(E log E).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm is O(E log E), where E represents the number of edges in the graph. This makes Kruskal's algorithm efficient for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph, especially when the number of edges is much larger than the number of vertices. Understanding the time complexity helps in analyzing the scalability of the algorithm and choosing the right approach for solving similar graph-related problems.
