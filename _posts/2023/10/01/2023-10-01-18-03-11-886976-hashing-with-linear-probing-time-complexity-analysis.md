## Introduction

Hashing with linear probing is a collision resolution technique used in hash tables. In this blog post, we will explore the time complexity of this technique and analyze its efficiency in different scenarios.

## Hashing with Linear Probing

Hashing is a technique used to map data to a fixed-size array called a hash table. It involves applying a hash function to the input data to generate an index where the data should be stored in the hash table.

When a collision occurs, i.e., two different data items are hashed to the same index, linear probing is used to resolve it. Linear probing works by finding the next available slot in the hash table and storing the data item there.

## Time Complexity Analysis

### Insertion

The time complexity of inserting an element into a hash table using linear probing depends on the load factor (the ratio of filled slots to the total number of slots) and the number of collisions that occur.

In the best case scenario, with a low load factor and no collisions, the insertion operation has a time complexity of O(1), as the desired slot is empty, and the element can be inserted directly.

In the worst case scenario, when the hash table is nearly full or multiple collisions occur, the time complexity of insertion using linear probing becomes O(n), where n is the number of slots in the hash table. This is because each collision requires searching for the next available slot by sequentially checking the next slots in the array until an empty slot is found.

### Search

The time complexity of searching for an element in a hash table using linear probing is also affected by the load factor and the number of collisions.

In the best case scenario, when there are no collisions and the element is present in the hash table, the search operation has a time complexity of O(1). This is because the desired element can be found directly at the hashed index.

In the worst case scenario, when the hash table is nearly full or multiple collisions occur, the time complexity of searching using linear probing becomes O(n), as we may need to check every slot in the hash table until we find the element or determine that it is not present.

## Conclusion

Hashing with linear probing is a simple and effective collision resolution technique. However, its time complexity can vary based on factors such as the load factor and the number of collisions. It provides constant time complexity for insertion and searching in the best case scenario, but can have a worst case time complexity of O(n) when there are many collisions.

By understanding the time complexity of hashing with linear probing, we can make informed decisions about when and how to use this technique. It is essential to consider the expected workload and the properties of the data being stored to achieve optimal performance.
