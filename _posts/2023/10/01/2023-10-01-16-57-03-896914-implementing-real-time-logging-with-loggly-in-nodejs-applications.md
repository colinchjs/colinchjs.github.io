## Prerequisites
Before we proceed, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Node.js installed on your machine.
2. A valid Loggly account.

## Setting up Loggly
To get started, you need to create a new Loggly HTTP/S endpoint to receive logs from your Node.js application. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Log in to your Loggly account.
2. Go to the **Source Setup** section and click on **HTTP/S**.
3. Click on **Add New Endpoint**.
4. Give your endpoint a name and choose the desired log format (e.g., JSON).
5. Click on **Save** to create your endpoint.
6. Note down the provided **Endpoint URL**.

## Installing Loggly library
Next, we need to install the Loggly library to send logs from our Node.js application to Loggly seamlessly. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project folder. Then, run the following command:

```shell
npm install loggly
```

This command will install the Loggly library and add it to your `package.json` file.

## Configuring Loggly in your Node.js application
To configure Loggly in your Node.js application, follow these steps:

1. Open your application's main file (e.g., `app.js` or `index.js`).
2. Require the Loggly library:

   ```javascript
   const loggly = require('loggly');
   ```

3. Create a new Loggly client and configure it using your endpoint URL and any additional options:

   ```javascript
   const client = loggly.createClient({
     token: 'YOUR_LOGGLY_TOKEN',
     subdomain: 'YOUR_LOGGLY_SUBDOMAIN',
     endpoint: 'YOUR_LOGGLY_ENDPOINT_URL',
     tags: ['production', 'nodejs-app']
   });
   ```

   Make sure to replace the `YOUR_LOGGLY_TOKEN`, `YOUR_LOGGLY_SUBDOMAIN`, and `YOUR_LOGGLY_ENDPOINT_URL` placeholders with your actual Loggly credentials and endpoint URL.

4. Start logging messages to Loggly using the created client:

   ```javascript
   client.log('info', 'This is a test log message', { someData: 'example' });
   ```

   The first parameter represents the log level (e.g., 'info', 'error', 'debug'), the second parameter is the log message, and the third parameter is an optional object containing additional data.

## Viewing logs in real-time
With Loggly successfully configured in your Node.js application, you can now view your logs in real-time. Log in to your Loggly account and navigate to the **Logs** section. You should see your logs streaming in as they are generated by your application.

## Conclusion
By integrating Loggly into your Node.js applications, you can easily implement real-time logging and gain valuable insights into your application's behavior. This allows you to identify and resolve issues quickly, improving the overall stability and performance of your Node.js applications.

Start leveraging the power of Loggly today and take your logging to the next level!
