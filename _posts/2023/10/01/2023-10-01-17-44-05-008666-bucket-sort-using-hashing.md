In this blog post, we will explore the bucket sort algorithm using hashing. Bucket sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input array into a number of equally-sized subarrays, called buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm.

## Hashing in Bucket Sort

In bucket sort, hashing is used to distribute the elements into different buckets based on their values. The idea is to choose a hash function that evenly distributes the elements across the buckets. Each bucket can then be independently sorted, resulting in an overall sorted sequence once all the buckets are concatenated.

## Implementation

Here is an example implementation of bucket sort using hashing in Python:

```python
def bucket_sort(arr):
    # Determine the number of buckets
    num_buckets = len(arr)

    # Create empty buckets
    buckets = [[] for _ in range(num_buckets)]

    # Compute the maximum value in the array
    max_value = max(arr)

    # Choose a hash function and distribute elements into buckets
    for num in arr:
        index = int(num * num_buckets / (max_value + 1))
        buckets[index].append(num)

    # Sort each bucket
    for bucket in buckets:
        bucket.sort()

    # Concatenate the sorted buckets
    sorted_arr = [num for bucket in buckets for num in bucket]

    return sorted_arr
```

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of bucket sort depends on the underlying sorting algorithm used to sort the individual buckets, as well as the distribution of elements into the buckets. In the best case, when all the elements are uniformly distributed, bucket sort can have a complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements. However, in the worst case, when all the elements fall into a single bucket, the time complexity can be O(n^2) if a comparison-based sorting algorithm is used.

The space complexity of bucket sort is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

## Conclusion

Bucket sort using hashing is an efficient sorting algorithm when the elements are uniformly distributed. It provides a way to divide the input into smaller subarrays, sort them independently, and then concatenate them to obtain a sorted sequence. By choosing an appropriate hash function, we can distribute the elements evenly across the buckets, which improves the overall performance of the algorithm.
