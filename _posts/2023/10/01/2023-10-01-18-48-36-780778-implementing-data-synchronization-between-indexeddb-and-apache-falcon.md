## Introduction

Data synchronization is a critical aspect of modern web applications, allowing users to access and manipulate data across multiple devices and platforms. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement data synchronization between IndexedDB, a client-side database, and Apache Falcon, a powerful data integration and processing framework.

## IndexedDB: A Brief Overview

IndexedDB is a web browser standard that provides a client-side database for storing large amounts of structured data. It enables web applications to work offline, persistent storage, and efficient data retrieval. However, IndexedDB does not provide built-in capabilities for data synchronization with remote servers.

## Apache Falcon: An Introduction

Apache Falcon is a data integration and processing framework that provides a scalable and reliable way to move, transform, and process data between various data sources and sinks. It simplifies the data pipeline management by providing a centralized platform for data ingestion, transformation, and delivery. Falcon supports various data sources, including databases, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Amazon S3, and more.

## Implementing Data Synchronization

To implement data synchronization between IndexedDB and Apache Falcon, we can follow these steps:

### 1. Setup Apache Falcon

First, we need to set up Apache Falcon and configure the required data sources and sinks. This involves installing Falcon, configuring connection properties, and defining data entities in Falcon's XML configuration file.

### 2. Establish IndexedDB Connection

Next, we need to establish a connection to IndexedDB using JavaScript. We can use the `indexedDB` API to create or open a database, create an object store, and handle events for database operations.

### 3. Data Extraction

Once the connection is established, we can extract data from IndexedDB by performing read operations on the object store. We can use cursor operations to iterate over the object store and retrieve the required data.

### 4. Transform and Load Data in Falcon

After extracting data from IndexedDB, we need to transform and load it into Apache Falcon. We can use Falcon's data ingestion capabilities to transform the data into a compatible format and load it into the target data sink.

### 5. Schedule Data Synchronization

To keep the data synchronized between IndexedDB and Apache Falcon, we need to schedule periodic synchronization tasks. We can leverage Falcon's scheduling feature to define recurring workflows that fetch data from IndexedDB and load it into Apache Falcon at regular intervals.

## Conclusion

Implementing data synchronization between IndexedDB and Apache Falcon enables real-time data access and manipulation across different platforms and devices. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can integrate the powerful capabilities of Apache Falcon with the client-side storage capabilities of IndexedDB, delivering a seamless and robust data synchronization solution.
