Hashing is a widely used technique in computer science to efficiently store and retrieve data. Quadratic probing is a method used to handle collisions in hash tables. In this article, we will explore the time complexity analysis of hashing with quadratic probing.

## Understanding Hashing with Quadratic Probing

Before we dive into the time complexity analysis, let's understand how hashing with quadratic probing works.

In a hash table using quadratic probing, the hash function converts a key into a hash value which is used as an index to store the data in an array. If there is a collision (two keys hash to the same index), quadratic probing attempts to find the next available index by using an incrementing quadratic sequence.

The quadratic probing sequence is calculated by adding an incrementing quadratic term (`i^2`) to the original hash value. This generates a new index to check for collision until an empty slot is found.

## Time Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of hashing with quadratic probing depends on several factors, including the number of elements in the hash table, the hash function, and the load factor.

- **Insertion**: The time complexity for insertion in hashing with quadratic probing is typically O(1). However, when the load factor increases and collisions occur more frequently, the time complexity can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the hash table.

- **Search**: The time complexity for searching in hashing with quadratic probing is similar to insertion. In the best case, when there are no collisions, the time complexity is O(1). However, when collisions occur, the time complexity can increase to O(n).

- **Deletion**: The time complexity for deletion in hashing with quadratic probing is also similar to insertion and search. In the best case, when there are no collisions, the time complexity is O(1). However, when collisions occur, the time complexity can increase to O(n).

## Factors Affecting Time Complexity

The time complexity analysis discussed above assumes an ideal scenario with a well-distributed hash function and a low load factor. However, several factors can impact the actual time complexity, including:

- **Load Factor**: A high load factor leads to more collisions, increasing the time complexity for insertion, search, and deletion.

- **Distribution of Hash Values**: A poorly distributed hash function can lead to more collisions, impacting the time complexity.

- **Size of Hash Table**: The size of the hash table can also impact the time complexity. If the size is not properly chosen or adjusted dynamically, the number of collisions can increase, affecting performance.

## Conclusion

Hashing with quadratic probing is an efficient method for handling collisions in hash tables. The time complexity analysis of hashing with quadratic probing shows that it provides constant-time complexity for insertion, search, and deletion in the best case scenario. However, as the load factor increases and collisions occur, the time complexity can degrade to linear.

Understanding the factors that impact the time complexity is crucial to design and optimize hash tables effectively. By considering factors like the load factor, hash function distribution, and proper sizing, we can mitigate the impact of collisions and maintain optimal performance.
