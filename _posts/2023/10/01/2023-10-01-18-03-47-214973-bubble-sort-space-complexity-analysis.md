Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the entire list is sorted. In this blog post, we will analyze the space complexity of Bubble Sort.

Space complexity is the amount of memory required by an algorithm to run and solve a problem. It refers to the additional space used by the algorithm, apart from the input values.

When it comes to Bubble Sort, the space complexity is relatively low because it does not require any additional space apart from the input array. Bubble Sort performs all its operations in place, meaning it modifies the original array without creating a new copy or using any auxiliary data structures.

Let's take a closer look at the space complexity of Bubble Sort:

### Worst Case Space Complexity

In the worst case scenario, the input array is completely unsorted, and Bubble Sort has to perform multiple swaps to sort the elements. Even in this case, Bubble Sort only requires a constant amount of additional space. This is because Bubble Sort only needs a few variables to keep track of the indices during the swapping process.

Therefore, the worst-case space complexity of Bubble Sort is **O(1)**, which indicates constant space usage. Regardless of the size of the input array, Bubble Sort will always use the same amount of space.

### Best Case Space Complexity

In the best case scenario, the input array is already sorted, and Bubble Sort doesn't need to perform any swaps. In this case, Bubble Sort still requires the same amount of additional space as in the worst case, namely **O(1)**.

### Summary

- Bubble Sort has a low space complexity and uses only a constant amount of additional space.
- The worst-case and best-case space complexity of Bubble Sort is O(1), indicating constant space usage.
- Bubble Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, which means it modifies the original array without requiring additional memory.

Knowing the space complexity of algorithms can help us make informed decisions about which sorting algorithm to choose, based on the available memory resources. Bubble Sort, with its low space complexity, can be a suitable option when memory is a constraint.

So, next time you need to sort an array or understand space complexity, consider Bubble Sort as a simple yet efficient sorting algorithm.
