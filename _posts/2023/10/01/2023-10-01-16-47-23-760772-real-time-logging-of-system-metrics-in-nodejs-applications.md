Monitoring system metrics in real-time is crucial for understanding the performance and health of your Node.js applications. By logging these metrics, you can identify potential bottlenecks, track resource usage, and troubleshoot issues promptly.

In this article, we will explore how to implement real-time logging of system metrics in Node.js applications using the popular Node.js library `os-utils`.

## Installing `os-utils`

To get started, let's install the `os-utils` library by running the following command:

```shell
npm install os-utils
```

## Logging CPU Usage

To log the CPU usage in real-time, we can utilize the `os-utils` library's `cpuUsage` function. Let's see how we can do that:

```javascript
const osUtils = require('os-utils');

setInterval(() => {
  osUtils.cpuUsage((value) => {
    console.log(`CPU Usage: ${value}%`);
  });
}, 1000);
```

In the above example, we are calling the `cpuUsage` function every second to get the CPU usage. The value returned by the function represents the percentage usage of the CPU.

## Logging Memory Usage

Logging memory usage is equally important for monitoring the health of your Node.js application. The `os-utils` library provides a `freememPercentage` function that gives us the free memory percentage. Here's an example:

```javascript
const osUtils = require('os-utils');

setInterval(() => {
  osUtils.freememPercentage((value) => {
    console.log(`Free Memory: ${value}%`);
  });
}, 1000);
```

By calling the `freememPercentage` function periodically, we can log the current free memory percentage of the system.

## Conclusion

Real-time logging of system metrics allows us to observe the behavior of our Node.js applications in terms of CPU and memory usage. By monitoring these metrics, we can promptly identify performance issues and take necessary actions to optimize our applications.

Remember, monitoring system metrics should be an ongoing process to ensure the stability and efficiency of your Node.js applications. So, start implementing real-time logging of system metrics today and keep an eye on the health of your applications.
