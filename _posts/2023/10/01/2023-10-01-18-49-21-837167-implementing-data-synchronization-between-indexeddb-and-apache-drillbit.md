In today's modern applications, data synchronization is a critical aspect for ensuring that data across different storage systems remains consistent and up to date. In this blog post, we will explore how to achieve data synchronization between IndexedDB, a client-side browser database, and Apache Drillbit, a distributed query execution engine.

## Why Data Synchronization?

Before diving into the implementation details, let's understand why data synchronization is important. In many applications, data is stored in different databases or systems. For example, an application might use IndexedDB to store offline data on the client-side, and Apache Drillbit to query and analyze data stored in a distributed cluster.

To ensure that the data in these systems remains consistent, it is necessary to synchronize updates made in one system to the other. This allows the applications to have a unified and up-to-date view of the data, regardless of where it is stored.

## Implementing Data Synchronization

To implement data synchronization between IndexedDB and Apache Drillbit, we can follow these steps:

1. **Capture Changes:** When a change occurs in the IndexedDB, such as an insert, update, or delete operation, we need to capture these changes and keep a record of them.

2. **Send Changes to Apache Drillbit:** Whenever a change is captured on the client side, we can send the details of the change to the Apache Drillbit server. This can be achieved using REST APIs or any other communication mechanism supported by Apache Drillbit.

3. **Apply Changes in Apache Drillbit:** On the Apache Drillbit side, we need to receive the changes and apply them to the appropriate data storage. This can involve executing queries or performing direct updates based on the type of change received.

4. **Handle Conflicts:** In a distributed environment, conflicts may arise when updates are made simultaneously to the same data item in both IndexedDB and Apache Drillbit. To handle conflicts, we must define conflict resolution strategies that determine how conflicts are resolved in such scenarios.

## Conclusion

By implementing data synchronization between IndexedDB and Apache Drillbit, we can ensure that data remains consistent and up to date across different storage systems. This allows applications to work seamlessly with data stored in distributed clusters while retaining the ability to work offline using client-side storage.
