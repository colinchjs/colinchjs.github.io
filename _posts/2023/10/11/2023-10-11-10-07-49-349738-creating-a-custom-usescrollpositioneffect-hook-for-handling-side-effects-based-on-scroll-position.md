In this blog post, we will learn how to create a custom React hook called `useScrollPositionEffect` that will allow us to handle side effects based on the scroll position of the user's browser window. This can be useful for implementing features such as parallax scrolling, lazy loading, or any other effect that needs to be triggered based on how far the user has scrolled.

## Introduction to the useScrollPositionEffect hook {#introduction}

The `useScrollPositionEffect` hook will help us simplify the logic required to handle side effects based on the scroll position. It will provide us with a callback function that will be called every time the user scrolls, passing the current scroll position as parameters. This will allow us to easily define what should happen when the user scrolls to a specific position.

## Implementing the useScrollPositionEffect hook {#implementation}

Let's start by creating a new file called `useScrollPositionEffect.js` and defining our custom hook inside it:

```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react';

const useScrollPositionEffect = (callback) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleScroll = () => {
      const scrollPosition = window.scrollY;
      callback(scrollPosition);
    };

    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
    };
  }, [callback]);
};

export default useScrollPositionEffect;
```

In the code above, we are using the `useEffect` hook to add an event listener for the `scroll` event. Inside the event listener, we are getting the current scroll position using `window.scrollY` and calling the provided `callback` function with this value. We are also using the `useEffect` hook's cleanup function to remove the event listener when the component using the hook is unmounted.

## Using the useScrollPositionEffect hook {#usage}

Now that we have implemented our `useScrollPositionEffect` hook, let's see how we can use it in a React component. Here's an example of a component that changes its background color based on the scroll position:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import useScrollPositionEffect from './useScrollPositionEffect';

const ScrollColorEffect = () => {
  const handleScroll = (scrollPosition) => {
    // Logic to change background color based on scroll position
    if (scrollPosition > 200) {
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
    } else {
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'white';
    }
  };

  useScrollPositionEffect(handleScroll);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ScrollColorEffect;
```

In the code above, we define a component called `ScrollColorEffect` that uses our custom hook. We provide the `handleScroll` function as the callback to be called when the user scrolls. Inside this function, we change the background color of the `document.body` based on the scroll position. This is just a simple example, but you can use the same pattern to implement more complex effects.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

In this blog post, we have learned how to create a custom React hook called `useScrollPositionEffect` for handling side effects based on the scroll position. This hook simplifies the logic required to handle scrolling effects and allows us to define what should happen at specific scroll positions. Feel free to customize this hook to fit your specific needs, and happy coding!
