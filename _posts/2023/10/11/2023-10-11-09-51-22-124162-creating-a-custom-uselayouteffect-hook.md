In React, the `useLayoutEffect` hook is similar to the `useEffect` hook, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. This makes it ideal for manipulating the DOM or performing measurements before the browser paints the screen.

While React provides the `useLayoutEffect` hook out of the box, we may encounter situations where we need to create our own custom hooks for specific needs. In this blog post, we will walk through the steps to create a custom `useLayoutEffect` hook.

## Why Create a Custom `useLayoutEffect` Hook?

Creating a custom `useLayoutEffect` hook allows us to encapsulate logic that needs to be executed synchronously after DOM updates. This can make our code more reusable, modular, and easier to test.

## Implementing the Custom `useLayoutEffect` Hook

To create a custom `useLayoutEffect` hook, we'll follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary dependencies:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
```

2. Define our custom hook:

```jsx
const useCustomLayoutEffect = (effect, deps) => {
  const mountedRef = useRef(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (mountedRef.current) {
      return effect();
    } else {
      mountedRef.current = true;
    }
  }, deps);
};
```

In the code above, we create a custom hook called `useCustomLayoutEffect`. It takes two arguments: `effect` (the effect function we want to run) and `deps` (the dependency array). We also create a `mountedRef` using the `useRef` hook to keep track of the mount state.

3. Usage:

Now that we have our custom `useCustomLayoutEffect` hook, we can use it in our components. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  useCustomLayoutEffect(() => {
    // DOM manipulation or measurements
    // runs synchronously after DOM update
  }, []);

  // rest of the component logic

  return (
    // component JSX
  );
}
```

In the example above, we use `useCustomLayoutEffect` in our functional component `MyComponent` to perform any DOM manipulations or measurements that need to happen synchronously after the DOM updates.

## Conclusion

By creating a custom `useLayoutEffect` hook, we can encapsulate logic that needs to be executed synchronously after DOM updates. This can make our code more reusable, modular, and easier to test. Remember to be mindful of the performance implications of using `useLayoutEffect`, as it runs synchronously and may impact rendering performance.

Using custom hooks is a powerful feature in React, allowing us to create reusable abstractions.
