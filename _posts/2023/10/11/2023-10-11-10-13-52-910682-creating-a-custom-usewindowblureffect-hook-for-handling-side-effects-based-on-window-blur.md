In this tech blog post, we will explore how to create a custom React hook called `useWindowBlurEffect`. This hook will allow you to easily handle side effects in your application based on the window blur event. We will walk through the steps to create this hook and show you how to utilize it in your code.

## Introduction

In many applications, there may be a need to trigger specific actions when the user switches focus away from the application window. This could be useful for scenarios such as pausing a video player or disabling auto-saving when the user is not actively interacting with the application.

To achieve this functionality, we can create a custom React hook that listens for the `blur` event on the `window` object and executes specified side effects when the event occurs.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into creating the `useWindowBlurEffect` hook, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- React (version 16.8 or higher) 
- Basic knowledge of React Hooks

## Creating the Hook

To create the `useWindowBlurEffect` hook, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary dependencies:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
```

2. Define the `useWindowBlurEffect` hook:

```jsx
const useWindowBlurEffect = (effect) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleBlur = () => {
      effect();
    };

    window.addEventListener('blur', handleBlur);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('blur', handleBlur);
    };
  }, [effect]);
};
```

3. Export the `useWindowBlurEffect` hook:

```jsx
export default useWindowBlurEffect;
```

## Using the `useWindowBlurEffect` Hook

Now that we have created the `useWindowBlurEffect` hook, let's see how it can be used in a React component. 

Here's an example of how you can use the hook to toggle a boolean state when the window loses focus:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import useWindowBlurEffect from './useWindowBlurEffect';

const App = () => {
  const [isWindowFocused, setWindowFocused] = useState(true);

  useWindowBlurEffect(() => {
    setWindowFocused(false);
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {isWindowFocused ? (
        <h1>Application is in focus</h1>
      ) : (
        <h1>Application is not in focus</h1>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, whenever the window loses focus, the `useWindowBlurEffect` hook will trigger the provided side effect of setting the `isWindowFocused` state to `false`. 

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have learned how to create a custom React hook called `useWindowBlurEffect` for handling side effects based on window blur events. By utilizing this hook, you can easily add behavior to your application when the user switches focus away from the window. The hook allows for clean and reusable code, improving the modularity and maintainability of your React components.

We hope you find this custom hook useful in handling window blur effects in your React applications! #React #CustomHook
