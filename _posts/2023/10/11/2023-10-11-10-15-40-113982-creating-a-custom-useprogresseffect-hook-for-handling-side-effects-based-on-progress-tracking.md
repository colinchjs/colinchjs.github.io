One common scenario in web development is the need to perform certain actions based on the progress of an operation. Whether it's loading data from an API, rendering elements based on the scroll position, or animating components during a transition, handling side effects based on progress tracking is a recurring requirement.

In this blog post, we will explore how to create a custom React hook called `useProgressEffect` to handle side effects based on progress tracking.

### Understanding `useProgressEffect`
The `useProgressEffect` hook we're going to create will allow us to execute certain actions based on a specific progress value. It will take in a progress value as an argument and a callback function that will be triggered whenever the progress value updates within a specified range.

### Implementing the `useProgressEffect` Hook
Let's start by defining the initial structure and basic logic of our `useProgressEffect` hook:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const useProgressEffect = (progress, callback, min = 0, max = 100) => {
  const prevProgressRef = useRef(progress);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (prevProgressRef.current !== progress) {
      if (progress >= min && progress <= max) {
        callback();
      }
      prevProgressRef.current = progress;
    }
  }, [progress, callback, min, max]);
};

export default useProgressEffect;
```

In the `useProgressEffect` hook, we use the `useEffect` hook to listen for changes in the `progress` value. We compare the current `progress` value with the previous value stored in a ref using the `useRef` hook, and if they differ, we check if the `progress` value is within the specified range (`min` and `max`). If it is, we call the provided `callback` function.

### Using the `useProgressEffect` Hook
Now that we have our custom `useProgressEffect` hook, let's see how we can use it in a practical example. Suppose we have a component that fetches some data from an API, and we want to trigger an alert when the progress reaches 50%:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import useProgressEffect from './useProgressEffect';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulating API call progress
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setProgress((prevProgress) => prevProgress + 10);
    }, 1000);
    
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  useProgressEffect(progress, () => {
    if (progress === 50) {
      alert('50% progress reached!');
    }
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Loading Data...</h1>
      <p>Progress: {progress}%</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we simulate the progress of an API call by increasing the `progress` state value every second. We use the `useEffect` hook to initiate the progress update and clear the interval on component unmount. We then use our custom `useProgressEffect` hook to trigger an alert when the progress reaches 50%.

### Conclusion
Being able to handle side effects based on progress tracking is a valuable skill in web development. By creating a custom hook like `useProgressEffect`, we can easily encapsulate this logic and reuse it across different components.

In this blog post, we've covered how to create a `useProgressEffect` hook that allows us to execute actions based on a specific progress value range. We've also demonstrated its usage in a practical example.

By leveraging the power of custom hooks, we can make our code more reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.
