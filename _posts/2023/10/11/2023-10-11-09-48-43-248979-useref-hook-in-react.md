In React, the `useRef` hook allows us to preserve values between re-renders of a component. It returns a mutable ref object which can hold a mutable value.

## Usage

To use the `useRef` hook, we first need to import it from the React library:

```js
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
```

Next, within our functional component, we can declare a variable using the `useRef` hook:

```js
const myRef = useRef();
```

We can then attach this ref to a DOM element or any other value we want to preserve.

## Handling DOM elements

The most common use case for `useRef` is to reference DOM elements. Let's see an example:

```js
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the above example, we create a ref using `useRef` and assign it to the `ref` prop of the `input` element. This allows us to access the DOM node using `inputRef.current`. In the `useEffect` hook, we call the `focus` method on the `current` property to give the input element focus when the component mounts.

## Other use cases

`useRef` can be used for more than just referencing DOM elements. Here are a few other use cases:

### Preserving previous values

```js
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const previousCountRef = useRef();
  const count = 0;

  useEffect(() => {
    previousCountRef.current = count;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Previous Count: {previousCountRef.current}</p>
      <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we use `useRef` to store the previous value of `count` and display it in the component.

### Storing mutable values without causing re-render

```js
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const renderCount = useRef(0);

  renderCount.current += 1;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Render Count: {renderCount.current}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, we use `useRef` to store a mutable value (`renderCount`) that doesn't cause the component to re-render when it changes. This can be useful for tracking certain values without triggering unnecessary re-renders.

## Conclusion

The `useRef` hook in React is a powerful tool for preserving values between re-renders. Whether it's referencing DOM elements or storing mutable values, `useRef` allows us to work with mutable values in a functional component. It's a handy addition to React's hooks API.
