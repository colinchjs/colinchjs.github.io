Managing global state in React applications can be a challenging task. While there are several libraries available, such as Redux or MobX, sometimes you may want to create a custom hook to handle global state in a more simplified and tailored manner. In this blog post, we will walk through the process of creating a custom `useGlobalState` hook in React.

## Introduction

Global state refers to any state that needs to be accessed by multiple components in a React application. In contrast to local component state, global state allows you to share data across different components without manually passing props down the component tree.

## Setting up the Project

Before creating our custom hook, let's set up a new React project using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app global-state-app
```

This will create a new directory called `global-state-app` with a basic React project structure.

## Creating the `useGlobalState` Hook

In the project directory, navigate to the `src` folder and create a new file called `useGlobalState.js`.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const useGlobalState = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    // Place any initialization logic here
  }, []);

  const setGlobalState = (newState) => {
    setState((prevState) => ({
      ...prevState,
      ...newState
    }));
  };

  return [state, setGlobalState];
};

export default useGlobalState;
```

In this custom hook, we use the `useState` hook to initialize the global state and the `useEffect` hook to perform any necessary initialization when the hook is first used.

The `setGlobalState` function allows us to update the global state by merging the new state with the previous state.

## Using the `useGlobalState` Hook

Now that we have our custom `useGlobalState` hook, let's demonstrate how we can use it in a React component.

In `src/App.js`, replace the existing code with the following:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import useGlobalState from './useGlobalState';

const App = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useGlobalState();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Global State App</h1>
      <p>Global State: {JSON.stringify(state)}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setState({ count: state.count ? state.count + 1 : 1 })}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we import and use our `useGlobalState` hook in the `App` component. We display the current global state as a JSON string and provide a button to increment the `count` property in the state.

Now, if you start the development server by running `npm start`, you should be able to see the `Global State App` with the initial state displayed.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned about managing global state in a React application and created a custom `useGlobalState` hook to handle it. With a simple function call, we can easily access and update the global state across different components.

Remember, creating a custom hook allows you to tailor the behavior of the global state management based on your specific needs. So, go ahead and experiment with it in your next React project!
