When developing React applications, it is important to have adequate tools and techniques to debug and inspect the state of your components. One such tool is the `useDebugValue` hook introduced in React 16.8. This hook allows you to label custom hooks and provide custom debug values to be displayed in React DevTools.

## Understanding the useDebugValue Hook

The `useDebugValue` hook is a built-in hook provided by React. It enables you to customize the display name and value shown for a custom hook when inspecting it in the React DevTools.

Typically, when you create a custom hook, it is displayed in React DevTools as "CustomHook" by default. However, by using the `useDebugValue` hook, you can override this default behavior and display a more meaningful label and value.

## Usage of the useDebugValue Hook

To begin using the `useDebugValue` hook, you first need to import it from the React library:

```jsx
import { useDebugValue } from 'react';
```

Next, within your custom hook, you can use the `useDebugValue` hook to provide a custom label and value:

```jsx
function useCustomHook() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Provide custom label and value for the custom hook
  useDebugValue('Custom Hook', count);

  // Rest of the custom hook logic
  // ...

  return count;
}
```

In the above example, we have a custom hook called `useCustomHook` that uses the `useDebugValue` hook to provide a custom label of "Custom Hook" and the current `count` value as the debug value.

## Viewing the Debug Value in React DevTools

After providing the custom label and value using `useDebugValue`, you can easily view it in the React DevTools.

To inspect the value of a custom hook, open the React DevTools extension in your browser's developer tools. Locate the component using the custom hook and expand it to see the debug value. It will display the custom label along with the current value.

## Conclusion

The `useDebugValue` hook is a powerful tool that allows you to provide meaningful labels and values for your custom hooks in React DevTools. By using this hook, you can enhance the debugging experience and quickly gain insights into the state and behavior of your components.

Remember to import the `useDebugValue` hook from the React library and call it within your custom hook to provide the desired label and value for debugging purposes.

By leveraging the `useDebugValue` hook effectively, you can streamline your debugging process and improve your React development workflow.
