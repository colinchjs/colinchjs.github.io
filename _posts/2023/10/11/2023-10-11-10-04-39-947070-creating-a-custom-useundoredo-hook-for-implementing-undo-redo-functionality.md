Undo-redo functionality is a common requirement in many applications, allowing users to reverse and restore their actions. In this blog post, we will walk through the process of creating a custom `useUndoRedo` hook in React to easily implement undo-redo functionality in our application.

## Introduction
Undo-redo functionality can be a powerful addition to any application, allowing users to undo their last action or redo a previously undone action. By creating a custom `useUndoRedo` hook, we can encapsulate the logic and state management required for implementing this feature.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you need to have a basic understanding of React hooks and functional components.

## Implementing the useUndoRedo Hook
Here's an example implementation of the `useUndoRedo` hook:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const useUndoRedo = (initialState) => {
  const [currentState, setCurrentState] = useState(initialState);
  const [pastStates, setPastStates] = useState([]);
  const [futureStates, setFutureStates] = useState([]);

  const undo = () => {
    if (pastStates.length === 0) return;

    const previousState = pastStates[pastStates.length - 1];
    const newPastStates = pastStates.slice(0, pastStates.length - 1);
    const newFutureStates = [...futureStates, currentState];

    setCurrentState(previousState);
    setPastStates(newPastStates);
    setFutureStates(newFutureStates);
  };

  const redo = () => {
    if (futureStates.length === 0) return;

    const nextState = futureStates[futureStates.length - 1];
    const newFutureStates = futureStates.slice(0, futureStates.length - 1);
    const newPastStates = [...pastStates, currentState];

    setCurrentState(nextState);
    setPastStates(newPastStates);
    setFutureStates(newFutureStates);
  };

  const updateState = (newState) => {
    setPastStates([...pastStates, currentState]);
    setCurrentState(newState);
    setFutureStates([]);
  };

  return [currentState, updateState, undo, redo];
};

export default useUndoRedo;
```

In the above code, we define a custom hook called `useUndoRedo`. It takes an `initialState` parameter and returns an array with the current state, an `updateState` function to set the current state, an `undo` function to revert to the previous state, and a `redo` function to redo an undone action.

The hook utilizes the `useState` hook to manage the current, past, and future states. The `undo` and `redo` functions update the states accordingly.

## Using the useUndoRedo Hook
To use the `useUndoRedo` hook in your React component, first import it:

```javascript
import useUndoRedo from './useUndoRedo';
```

Then, in your functional component, call the hook and destructure the returned values:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [currentState, updateState, undo, redo] = useUndoRedo('Initial state');

  // Rest of your component code

  return (
    // JSX code
  );
};
```

You can then use `currentState` to access the current state, `updateState` to update the state, and `undo` and `redo` to handle the undo and redo functionality.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to create a custom `useUndoRedo` hook in React for implementing undo-redo functionality. By encapsulating the logic and state management within the hook, we can easily incorporate this feature into our applications. Remember to handle the states and functions returned by the hook to enable undo and redo actions in your components.

Give it a try and enhance the user experience of your applications by adding undo-redo functionality using custom hooks.
