**Introduction**

In web development, draggable elements are commonly used to enable intuitive user interactions. However, handling side effects related to draggable elements can be a bit challenging. In this blog post, we will explore how to create a custom `useDraggableEffect` hook to handle these side effects more efficiently.

**What is a Hook?**

In React, hooks are functions that allow you to reuse stateful logic between components. They enable us to write reusable logic without the need for class components or higher-order components.

**Why Do We Need a Custom Hook?**

By default, React doesn't provide a built-in solution for handling side effects related to draggable elements. Therefore, creating a custom hook can help us simplify and manage these side effects more effectively in our codebase.

**Creating the useDraggableEffect Hook**

To create our custom `useDraggableEffect` hook, we need to follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary dependencies:

```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
```

2. Define the `useDraggableEffect` function:

```javascript
const useDraggableEffect = (ref, onDragStart, onDragEnd) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const element = ref.current;

    const handleDragStart = () => {
      onDragStart();
    };

    const handleDragEnd = () => {
      onDragEnd();
    };

    element.addEventListener('dragstart', handleDragStart);
    element.addEventListener('dragend', handleDragEnd);

    return () => {
      element.removeEventListener('dragstart', handleDragStart);
      element.removeEventListener('dragend', handleDragEnd);
    };
  }, [ref, onDragStart, onDragEnd]);
};
```

3. Using the useDraggableEffect Hook:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const draggableRef = useRef(null);

  useDraggableEffect(draggableRef, () => {
    console.log('Drag started!');
  }, () => {
    console.log('Drag ended!');
  });

  return (
    <div ref={draggableRef} draggable={true}>
      Drag me!
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Explanation**

- In step 1, we import the `useEffect` hook from React, which allows us to handle side effects.
- In step 2, we define the `useDraggableEffect` function that takes a `ref` to the draggable element, as well as two callbacks: `onDragStart` and `onDragEnd`. Inside the `useEffect` hook, we add event listeners for the 'dragstart' and 'dragend' events.
- We define separate functions `handleDragStart` and `handleDragEnd` to trigger the respective callbacks. We then attach these functions to the `dragstart` and `dragend` events of the draggable element.
- We also return a cleanup function from the `useEffect` hook to remove the event listeners when the component unmounts.
- In step 3, we demonstrate the usage of the `useDraggableEffect` hook in a component. We create a `draggableRef` using the `useRef` hook and pass it along with the `onDragStart` and `onDragEnd` callbacks to the `useDraggableEffect` hook. We then use the `draggableRef` to assign the `ref` prop to the draggable element.

**Conclusion**

Creating a custom `useDraggableEffect` hook allows us to encapsulate the side effects related to draggable elements in a reusable and manageable way. By writing a few lines of code, we can handle the complex interactions of draggable elements effectively. This helps improve the maintainability and readability of our codebase.
