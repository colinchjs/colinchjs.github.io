One common task in web development is copying text to the clipboard. In this tutorial, we will create a custom React hook called `useCopyToClipboard` that abstracts this functionality and provides an easy-to-use way to copy text to the clipboard.

## What is a React hook?
React hooks allow developers to add state and lifecycle events to functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and provide a simpler way to manage stateful logic in functional components.

## Copying text to clipboard
To copy text to the clipboard in JavaScript, we can use the Clipboard API, which provides a standardized way to interact with the clipboard. The `Clipboard.writeText()` method allows us to copy text to the clipboard.

## Creating the `useCopyToClipboard` hook
Let's start by creating a new file called `useCopyToClipboard.js` and define our `useCopyToClipboard` hook:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

const useCopyToClipboard = () => {
  const [isCopied, setIsCopied] = useState(false);

  const copyToClipboard = (text) => {
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(text)
      .then(() => {
        setIsCopied(true);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Failed to copy text to clipboard:', error);
      });
  };

  return [isCopied, copyToClipboard];
};

export default useCopyToClipboard;
```

In our `useCopyToClipboard` hook, we use the `useState` hook to manage the state of whether the text has been copied or not. We also define a function `copyToClipboard` that takes the text to be copied as an argument. Inside this function, we use the `Clipboard.writeText()` method to copy the text to the clipboard. If the copy is successful, we set the `isCopied` state to `true`. Otherwise, we log an error message to the console.

## Using the `useCopyToClipboard` hook
Now, let's use our `useCopyToClipboard` hook in a component. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```javascript
import useCopyToClipboard from './useCopyToClipboard';

const CopyToClipboardExample = () => {
  const [isCopied, copyToClipboard] = useCopyToClipboard();

  const handleCopy = () => {
    copyToClipboard('Text to be copied');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleCopy}>Copy to Clipboard</button>
      <p>{isCopied ? 'Text copied!' : 'Click the button to copy'}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CopyToClipboardExample;
```

In our example component, we import and use the `useCopyToClipboard` hook. We destructure the `isCopied` state and the `copyToClipboard` function from the hook's return value. We also define a `handleCopy` function that calls `copyToClipboard` with the text we want to copy. Finally, we render a button and a paragraph that displays the copy status depending on the value of `isCopied`.

## Conclusion
Creating a custom `useCopyToClipboard` hook allows us to easily integrate copy to clipboard functionality in our React components. Instead of writing repetitive code for each component that needs to copy text, we can simply use this reusable hook. This improves code reusability, reduces duplication, and promotes cleaner, more maintainable code.

Give it a try, and start simplifying the process of copying text to the clipboard in your React projects!
