URL validation and manipulation are common tasks in web development. JavaScript, being a versatile language, provides various approaches to handle URLs. One interesting technique is using ternary operations to validate and manipulate URLs. In this article, we will explore how to leverage ternary operations in JavaScript for URL validation and manipulation.

## URL Validation

Validating a URL ensures that it follows the correct syntax and structure. Here's an example of using a ternary operation to validate a URL in JavaScript:

```javascript
const validateURL = (url) => {
  const regex = /^(https?|ftp):\/\/[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*$/;
  return regex.test(url) ? `${url} is a valid URL` : `${url} is an invalid URL`;
};

console.log(validateURL('https://example.com')); // Output: https://example.com is a valid URL
console.log(validateURL('https:/example')); // Output: https:/example is an invalid URL
```

In the code above, we define the `validateURL` function that takes a URL as an input parameter. The function uses a regular expression (`regex`) to check if the URL matches the specified pattern. If the URL matches, the ternary operation returns a string indicating that it is a valid URL; otherwise, it returns a string indicating that it is an invalid URL.

## URL Manipulation

URL manipulation involves modifying and extracting specific components of a URL. Here's an example of how ternary operations can be used to manipulate a URL in JavaScript:

```javascript
const manipulateURL = (url, protocol) => {
  const defaultProtocol = 'https';
  const updatedURL = url.startsWith('http') ? url.replace(/(^\w+:|^)\/\//, `${protocol}://`) : `${defaultProtocol}://${url}`;
  return updatedURL;
};

console.log(manipulateURL('example.com', 'ftp')); // Output: ftp://example.com
console.log(manipulateURL('https://example.com', 'ftp')); // Output: ftp://example.com
```

In the code above, the `manipulateURL` function takes two parameters: the URL to manipulate (`url`) and the desired protocol (`protocol`). The function checks if the URL already starts with 'http' or 'https'. If it does, the ternary operation replaces the existing protocol with the desired one. If the URL does not already have a protocol, the ternary operation prepends the default protocol, 'https', to the URL.

## Conclusion

Ternary operations in JavaScript provide a concise and powerful way to validate and manipulate URLs. By incorporating regular expressions and conditional logic, we can create flexible and efficient URL handling functions. Using ternary operations in this context allows for cleaner and more readable code. Incorporate this technique in your web development projects to streamline URL validation and manipulation.

Keep in mind to use proper error handling when working with user-provided URLs and consider other validation techniques in conjunction with ternary operations for comprehensive URL validation.
