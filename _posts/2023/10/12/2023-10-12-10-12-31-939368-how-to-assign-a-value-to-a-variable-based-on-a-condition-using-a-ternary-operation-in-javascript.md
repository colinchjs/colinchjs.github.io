In JavaScript, the ternary operator provides a concise way to assign a value to a variable based on a condition. It is often used as a shorthand for simple if-else statements.

The syntax of the ternary operator is:

```
(condition) ? value1 : value2;
```

If the condition is true, then `value1` is assigned to the variable. Otherwise, `value2` is assigned.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the ternary operator:

```javascript
let age = 24;
let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";

console.log(canVote); // Output: Yes
```

In the above example, the condition `(age >= 18)` evaluates to `true`. Therefore, the value `"Yes"` is assigned to the `canVote` variable.

You can also nest ternary operations to handle multiple conditions. Here's an example:

```javascript
let temperature = 25;
let weatherCondition = (temperature > 30) ? "Hot" : (temperature < 20) ? "Cold" : "Moderate";

console.log(weatherCondition); // Output: Moderate
```

In this example, if the temperature is greater than 30, the `weatherCondition` variable will be set to `"Hot"`. If the temperature is less than 20, it will be set to `"Cold"`. Otherwise, it will be set to `"Moderate"`.

Ternary operations are a powerful way to write concise and readable code when the condition is simple and the resulting values are straightforward. However, it's important to avoid nesting too many ternary operations, as it can make the code harder to understand.

Remember to use the ternary operator wisely to maintain code readability and ensure that it doesn't sacrifice code clarity for conciseness.
