In JavaScript, you can use ternary operators to check if a variable exists or is defined. Ternary operators provide a concise way of writing conditional statements in a single line of code.

Here's an example of how you can use ternary operators to check the existence of a variable:

```javascript
const myVariable = "Hello, world!";

const variableExists = typeof myVariable !== "undefined" ? true : false;

console.log(variableExists); // Output: true
```

In the above code, we first declare the variable `myVariable` and assign it a value of "Hello, world!". Then, we use the ternary operator to check if `myVariable` is defined by comparing its type with the string "undefined". If the condition evaluates to `true`, the `variableExists` variable is assigned the value `true`. Otherwise, it is assigned the value `false`.

Finally, we log the value of `variableExists` to the console, which outputs `true` since `myVariable` is defined.

Using a ternary operator like this is a concise and efficient way to check if a variable exists in JavaScript. It avoids the need for longer if-else statements and reduces the code complexity.

Remember to always leverage JavaScript's built-in operators and language features to write clean and efficient code.
