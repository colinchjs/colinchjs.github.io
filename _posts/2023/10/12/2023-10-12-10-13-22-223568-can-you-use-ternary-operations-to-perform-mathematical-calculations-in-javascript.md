In JavaScript, ternary operators are commonly used as a shorthand way to perform conditional operations. While their primary purpose is to evaluate conditions and return a value based on the outcome, they can also be utilized to perform mathematical calculations.

The syntax of a ternary operator is as follows:

```javascript
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

Here, the `condition` is evaluated. If the condition is true, `expression1` is executed and its result is returned. If the condition is false, `expression2` is executed and its result is returned.

To perform mathematical calculations using ternary operators, we can simply include the desired expressions within the conditional statement. Let's consider an example where we want to find the absolute difference between two numbers:

```javascript
const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 8;

const difference = (num1 > num2) ? (num1 - num2) : (num2 - num1);

console.log(`The absolute difference is: ${difference}`);
```

In this example, if `num1` is greater than `num2`, `num1 - num2` will be evaluated and assigned to `difference`. Otherwise, `num2 - num1` will be evaluated and assigned to `difference`. The result is then printed to the console.

Ternary operators can also be used to perform more complex mathematical calculations by nesting them within each other. However, it is important to keep the code readable and maintainable, especially when performing complex calculations.

While ternary operators can be a convenient way to perform mathematical operations, it is crucial to use them judiciously. In some cases, using explicit `if` statements can be more readable and less prone to errors.

By leveraging the power of ternary operators, you can streamline and simplify mathematical calculations in your JavaScript code. Just ensure that you use them appropriately and keep your code clean and understandable.

More information on using ternary operators in JavaScript can be found in the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator).
