When writing JavaScript code, it's important to handle errors or exceptions gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience. One way to achieve this is by using ternary operations, which allow you to write conditional statements in a concise and expressive manner.

Ternary operations in JavaScript follow the syntax:
```
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

To handle errors or exceptions using ternary operations, you can use the following approach:

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might throw an error or exception
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error or exception
}
```

We can refactor this try-catch block into a ternary operation where the catch block is executed if an error occurs. Here's an example:

```javascript
const result = (() => {
  try {
    // Code that might throw an error or exception
    return someFunction();
  } catch (error) {
    // Code to handle the error or exception
    return "Error occurred: " + error.message;
  }
})();
```

In the example above, the ternary operation is wrapped inside an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to ensure the code runs immediately without assigning it to any specific variable. We first attempt to execute `someFunction()`, and if any error occurs, the catch block is executed, and the error message is returned as a string.

You can then use the `result` variable to handle the output based on whether an error occurred or not.

Using ternary operations in this way allows you to handle errors or exceptions in a more concise and readable manner. Additionally, it provides more control over the code flow and enables you to handle specific errors differently if needed.

Remember to decouple error handling from the main code logic to maintain a clean and modular codebase.

That's it! Now you know how to handle errors or exceptions using ternary operations in JavaScript.
