In JavaScript, null and undefined are two special values that represent the absence of a value. However, when working with these values, it's important to handle them properly to avoid any unexpected behavior or errors in your code.

One approach to handle null or undefined values is by using ternary operations. Ternary operations allow you to conditionally assign a value based on a condition. Here's how you can use ternary operations to handle null or undefined values:

## Using the Ternary Operator

The ternary operator in JavaScript follows the syntax: `condition ? expression1 : expression2`. If the condition is true, `expression1` is evaluated; otherwise, `expression2` is evaluated.

Let's consider an example where we want to assign a default value of "N/A" if a variable `name` is either null or undefined:

```javascript
const defaultName = name ? name : "N/A";
```

In the above code, if `name` is not null or undefined, it will be assigned to `defaultName`. Otherwise, "N/A" will be assigned as the default value.

## Simplifying with Nullish Coalescing Operator

In JavaScript, the Nullish Coalescing Operator `??` is designed to handle specific cases with null and undefined values. It provides a concise way to assign a default value only if the variable is null or undefined, but not for falsy values like empty strings, 0, or false.

Here's how you can use the Nullish Coalescing Operator:

```javascript
const defaultName = name ?? "N/A";
```

In the above code, `defaultName` will be assigned `name` if it is not null or undefined. Otherwise, it will be assigned the default value "N/A".

## Example Usage and Result

```javascript
let name1 = "John";
let name2 = null;
let name3 = undefined;

const defaultName1 = name1 ?? "N/A";
const defaultName2 = name2 ?? "N/A";
const defaultName3 = name3 ?? "N/A";

console.log(defaultName1); // Output: "John"
console.log(defaultName2); // Output: "N/A"
console.log(defaultName3); // Output: "N/A"
```

In the above example, `name1` is not null or undefined, so its value ("John") is assigned to `defaultName1`. However, `name2` and `name3` are either null or undefined, so "N/A" is assigned to `defaultName2` and `defaultName3`.

## Conclusion

Using ternary operations or the Nullish Coalescing Operator provides a way to handle null or undefined values in JavaScript. By properly assigning default values when necessary, you can ensure that your code behaves as expected and avoids any unexpected errors or bugs.
