Here's an example of using a ternary operation to convert a value to a different type:

```javascript
let input = "42";
let number = typeof input === "string" ? parseInt(input) : input;

console.log(number); // Output: 42 (as a number)
console.log(typeof number); // Output: number
```

In the above example, we convert the value of `input`, which is initially a string, into a number by using the `parseInt()` function. The ternary operator checks if the type of `input` is a string and if true, it converts it to a number using `parseInt()`. If the type is not a string, it leaves the value as is.

Ternary operations can be a convenient way to handle type conversions in certain situations. However, it's important to note that they should be used with caution as they can make the code less readable if overused or used in complex conditions.
