Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data. JavaScript, being a multi-paradigm language, allows us to use functional programming concepts alongside other paradigms.

One common feature in JavaScript is the use of ternary operations, which is a concise way of writing conditional statements. Ternary operations can be used in functional programming to create more readable and concise code.

Let's take a look at an example of using ternary operations in a functional programming paradigm in JavaScript:

```javascript
const hasPermission = (user) =>
  user.isAdmin ? "Admin" : "User";

const showPermissions = (user) => {
  const permission = hasPermission(user);
  console.log(`User ${user.username} has ${permission} permission.`);
};

const user = {
  username: "John",
  isAdmin: true
};

showPermissions(user);
```

In the above example, we have two functions: `hasPermission` and `showPermissions`. The `hasPermission` function takes a `user` object as an argument and uses a ternary operation to determine the user's permission. If the `isAdmin` property of the user object is `true`, it returns "Admin", otherwise it returns "User".

The `showPermissions` function takes a `user` object as an argument, calls the `hasPermission` function, and logs the user's permission to the console.

By using ternary operations, we can write concise and readable code to handle conditional logic in a functional programming paradigm. It helps to avoid the use of traditional if-else statements, promoting immutability and avoiding side effects.

In conclusion, ternary operations can be used effectively in functional programming paradigms in JavaScript to write more concise and readable code. It allows us to handle conditional logic in a more functional and declarative way. However, like any programming technique, it is important to use ternary operations judiciously and consider the readability and maintainability of the code overall.
