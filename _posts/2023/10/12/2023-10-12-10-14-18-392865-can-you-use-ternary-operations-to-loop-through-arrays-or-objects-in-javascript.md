To loop through an array using a ternary operator, you can combine it with the `forEach` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

myArray.forEach((item) => {
  (item % 2 === 0) ? console.log(`${item} is even`) : console.log(`${item} is odd`);
});
```

In this example, the ternary operator checks if each item in the array is even or odd. It then logs a corresponding message to the console.

To loop through an object using a ternary operator, you can combine it with the `Object.entries` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
const myObject = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

Object.entries(myObject).forEach(([key, value]) => {
  (typeof value === "string") ? console.log(`${key}: ${value}`) : console.log(``);
});
```

In this example, the ternary operator checks if the value is a string. If it is, it logs the key-value pair to the console.

Ternary operators can help you simplify your code when performing conditional operations in loops. However, it's important to use them judiciously and maintain readability to ensure your code remains understandable and maintainable.
