Here's an example of how you can utilize ternary operations to implement text search functionality:

```javascript
const searchString = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet";

// Perform a case-insensitive text search using ternary operation
const searchTerm = "ipsum";
const isFound = searchString.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ? "Text found!" : "Text not found!";

console.log(isFound);
```

In this example, we have a `searchString` variable and a `searchTerm` variable. We use the `includes()` method along with the ternary operator to check if the `searchTerm` is found within the `searchString`. By converting both strings to lowercase using `toLowerCase()`, we ensure a case-insensitive search.

If the `searchTerm` is found within the `searchString`, the ternary operator returns the string "Text found!". Otherwise, it returns the string "Text not found!". The result is then logged to the console.

You can modify this code snippet to suit your specific requirements. Additionally, you can combine it with other JavaScript functionalities like user input or iterating over an array of strings to implement a more robust text search functionality in your JavaScript applications.
