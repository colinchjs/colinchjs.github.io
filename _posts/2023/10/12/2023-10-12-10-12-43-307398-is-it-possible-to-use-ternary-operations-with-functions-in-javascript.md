To use ternary operations with functions, you can follow this syntax:

```
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
```

In the above syntax, the `condition` is evaluated, and if it is true, the `expressionIfTrue` is executed. However, if the `condition` is false, the `expressionIfFalse` is executed instead.

Let's consider an example to better understand how to use ternary operations with functions in JavaScript:

```javascript
function isEven(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0 ? 'Even' : 'Odd';
}

console.log(isEven(4));  // Output: Even
console.log(isEven(7));  // Output: Odd
```

In the above example, the `isEven` function takes a number as a parameter. Using the ternary operator, it checks if the given `number` is even (`number % 2 === 0`). If the condition is true, it returns the string `'Even'`, otherwise it returns the string `'Odd'`.

By using ternary operations with functions, you can write concise and readable code that handles conditional logic efficiently.

Remember to always consider readability and maintainability when using ternary operations, as overusing them in complex scenarios can make the code harder to understand. Moreover, take care to not sacrifice the clarity of your code for the sake of brevity.
