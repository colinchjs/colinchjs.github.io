GraphQL is a powerful query language used for APIs that allows clients to request specific data from a server. In JavaScript, there are several constructor functions available that make it easy to set up and use GraphQL.

## 1. `GraphQLSchema`

The `GraphQLSchema` constructor function is used to define the overall structure and behavior of your GraphQL API. It takes in an object that contains the root query and mutation types, as well as any subscriptions.

Here's an example of how to use the `GraphQLSchema` constructor function:

```javascript
const { GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType } = require('graphql');

const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
  query: new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'Query',
    fields: {
      // define your query fields here
    },
  }),
  mutation: new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'Mutation',
    fields: {
      // define your mutation fields here
    },
  }),
  subscription: new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: 'Subscription',
    fields: {
      // define your subscription fields here
    },
  }),
});
```

## 2. `GraphQLObjectType`

The `GraphQLObjectType` constructor function is used to define the different object types in your GraphQL schema. Each object type represents a specific entity or concept in your API.

Here's an example of how to use the `GraphQLObjectType` constructor function:

```javascript
const { GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLString } = require('graphql');

const userType = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'User',
  fields: {
    id: { type: GraphQLString },
    name: { type: GraphQLString },
    email: { type: GraphQLString },
  },
});
```

In the above example, we define a `User` object type with three fields: `id`, `name`, and `email`, each of type `GraphQLString`.

These are just two of the many constructor functions available in JavaScript for working with GraphQL. They provide a convenient way to define the structure and behavior of your GraphQL API.
