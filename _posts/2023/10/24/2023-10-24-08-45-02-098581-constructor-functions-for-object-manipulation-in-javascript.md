In JavaScript, constructor functions are used to create and initialize objects. They are useful when you need to create multiple instances of an object with the same properties and methods.

To create a constructor function, you use the `function` keyword followed by the name of the function. Inside the function, you define the properties and methods of the object using the `this` keyword. Here's an example:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  return "Hello, my name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.";
}

var john = new Person("John", 25);
console.log(john.greet()); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

In the code snippet above, we define a `Person` constructor function that takes `name` and `age` as parameters. Inside the function, we assign these parameters to the `name` and `age` properties of the object using the `this` keyword. 

We also add a `greet` method to the `Person` prototype, which returns a greeting string using the `name` and `age` properties.

To create an instance of the `Person` object, we use the `new` keyword followed by the constructor function name and pass the required arguments. In this case, we create a new `Person` object called `john` with the name "John" and age 25.

Finally, we can call the `greet` method on the `john` object to get the desired output.

By using constructor functions and prototypes, you can easily create and manipulate objects in JavaScript. It provides a way to define reusable blueprints for creating similar objects with shared properties and methods.

For more information, you can refer to the [MDN web docs on constructor functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor).
