To create a regular expression using the constructor function, you can use the `RegExp` object. Here's an example:

```javascript
const regex = new RegExp('pattern');
```

In the code above, the `RegExp` constructor function is used to create a regular expression object named `regex` with the specified pattern.

You can also pass in optional flags to modify the behavior of the regular expression. For example, to create a case-insensitive regular expression, you would use the `i` flag:

```javascript
const regex = new RegExp('pattern', 'i');
```

In this case, the regular expression will match the pattern regardless of case.

The constructor function also allows you to use special characters and metacharacters in your regular expressions. For example, you can use the `.` character to match any character, the `+` character to match one or more occurrences, or the `[]` characters to define a character set.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of the constructor function with special characters:

```javascript
const regex = new RegExp('a.c', 'i');
const match = regex.test('ABC');
console.log(match); // Output: true
```

In the code above, the regular expression `a.c` with the `i` flag is created. The `test` method is then used to check if the string `'ABC'` matches the pattern. Since the dot (`.`) character matches any character, the output will be `true`.

Overall, constructor functions for regular expressions in JavaScript provide a flexible way to create and customize regular expressions based on your specific requirements. With the ability to define patterns and apply flags, you can leverage regular expressions to perform powerful string manipulation and pattern matching in your JavaScript applications.
