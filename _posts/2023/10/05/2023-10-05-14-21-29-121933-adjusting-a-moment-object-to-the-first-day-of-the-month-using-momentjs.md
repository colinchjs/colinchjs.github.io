In JavaScript, Moment.js is a commonly used library for manipulating and formatting dates. It provides a simple and intuitive API for working with dates and times.

In this blog post, we will explore how to adjust a Moment.js object to the first day of the month. This can be useful in various scenarios where you need to perform calculations or comparisons within a specific month.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you have Moment.js installed in your project. You can easily install it by running the following command:

```javascript
npm install moment
```

## Adjusting the Moment object
To set the moment object to the first day of the month, we can make use of Moment.js' `startOf()` function. 

Here's an example of how you can adjust a moment object to the first day of the month:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

// Create a moment object representing the current date
const today = moment();

// Set the moment object to the first day of the month
const firstDayOfMonth = today.startOf('month');

// Output the adjusted moment object
console.log(firstDayOfMonth.format('YYYY-MM-DD'));
```

In the above code snippet, we first import the Moment.js library using `require`. We then create a moment object representing the current date using the `moment()` function. 

We subsequently use the `startOf()` function with the argument `'month'` to set the moment object to the first day of the month. Finally, we format and output the adjusted moment object using the `format()` function.

By using the `startOf()` function with the `'month'` parameter, Moment.js effectively adjusts the moment object to the first day of the current month, regardless of the current date.

## Conclusion
Adjusting a Moment.js object to the first day of the month is a common operation when working with dates and times. Moment.js provides a simple and straightforward way to achieve this using the `startOf()` function.

In this blog post, we explored how to adjust a Moment.js object to the first day of the month and provided an example code snippet. By following these steps, you can easily perform calculations and comparisons within a specific month in your JavaScript projects.
