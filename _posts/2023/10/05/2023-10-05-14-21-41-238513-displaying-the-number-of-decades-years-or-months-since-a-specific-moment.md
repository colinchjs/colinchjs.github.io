Let's dive into the code examples!

### Calculating Decades

To calculate the number of decades, we divide the number of years by 10. Here's an example in Python:

```python
def calculate_decades(years):
    decades = years // 10
    return decades
```

To use this function, simply pass the number of years as an argument:

```python
print(calculate_decades(45))  # Output: 4
```

This will return the number of decades since the specific moment.

### Calculating Years

To calculate the number of years, we can subtract the specific moment from the current year. Here's an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
function calculate_years(specificMoment) {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  const years = currentYear - specificMoment;
  return years;
}
```

Pass the specific moment as an argument to the function:

```javascript
console.log(calculate_years(1990));  // Output: 31
```

This will output the number of years since the specific moment.

### Calculating Months

To calculate the number of months, we can multiply the number of years by 12. Here's an example in Ruby:

```ruby
def calculate_months(years)
  months = years * 12
  return months
end
```

Use the function by passing the number of years:

```ruby
puts calculate_months(5)  # Output: 60
```

The output will be the number of months since the specific moment.

By using these code examples, you can easily calculate the number of decades, years, or months since a specific moment. Feel free to customize the code to suit your specific requirements.
