Moment.js is a popular JavaScript library that provides a simple and intuitive way to work with dates and times. In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Moment.js to calculate the number of hours between two moments.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Moment.js installed in your project. You can either download it from the official website or include it using a package manager like npm or yarn.

## Getting Started

To start calculating the number of hours between two moments using Moment.js, follow these steps:

1. Import the Moment.js library into your project:
```javascript
const moment = require('moment');
```

2. Create two moment objects representing the start and end moments:
```javascript
const startMoment = moment('2021-04-01 10:00:00');
const endMoment = moment('2021-04-01 14:30:00');
```

3. Calculate the difference between the two moments using the `diff` method:
```javascript
const duration = moment.duration(endMoment.diff(startMoment));
```

4. Retrieve the number of hours from the duration object:
```javascript
const hours = duration.asHours();
```

And that's it! Now you have the number of hours between the two moments.

## Example

Here's an example that shows how to calculate the number of hours between two moments:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

const startMoment = moment('2021-04-01 10:00:00');
const endMoment = moment('2021-04-01 14:30:00');

const duration = moment.duration(endMoment.diff(startMoment));
const hours = duration.asHours();

console.log(`The difference is ${hours} hours.`);
```

Output:
```
The difference is 4.5 hours.
```

## Conclusion

Using Moment.js, calculating the number of hours between two moments becomes a straightforward task. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can accurately determine the duration in hours and incorporate it into your JavaScript projects.
