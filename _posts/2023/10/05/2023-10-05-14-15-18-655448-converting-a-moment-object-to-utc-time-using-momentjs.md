Working with dates and times can be tricky, especially when dealing with time zones. Luckily, Moment.js is a popular JavaScript library that makes manipulating and formatting dates much easier. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to convert a `moment` object to UTC time using Moment.js.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have Moment.js installed in your project. You can install it via npm by running the following command:

```
npm install moment
```

Alternatively, you can include the Moment.js library in your HTML file using a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.29.1/moment.min.js"></script>
```

## Converting moment object to UTC
To convert a `moment` object to UTC time, we can use the `.utc()` method provided by Moment.js. This method converts the moment to the Coordinated Universal Time.

Here's an example of how to convert a `moment` object to UTC:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

const now = moment(); // Create a moment object representing the current time

const utcTime = now.utc(); // Convert to UTC time using the .utc() method

console.log(utcTime.format()); // Output the UTC time in a default format
```

In the example above, we first create a `moment` object `now` representing the current time. We then use the `.utc()` method to convert the `now` object to UTC time. Finally, we use the `.format()` method to format the UTC time and output it to the console.

You can specify a custom format for displaying the UTC time by passing a string parameter to the `.format()` method. For example:

```javascript
console.log(utcTime.format('YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss')); // Output the UTC time in a custom format
```

## Conclusion
By using Moment.js, converting a `moment` object to UTC time becomes a breeze. The `.utc()` method simplifies the conversion process, and the `.format()` method allows you to display the UTC time in your desired format.

Remember to always handle time zones and conversions carefully to ensure accurate and consistent results in your applications.

Now that you know how to convert a `moment` object to UTC time using Moment.js, you can confidently work with dates and times in your JavaScript projects.
