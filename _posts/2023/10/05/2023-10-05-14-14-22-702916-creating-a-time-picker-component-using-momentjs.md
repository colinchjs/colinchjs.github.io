## Setting Up Moment.js

Before we can start creating the time picker component, we need to include Moment.js in our project. You can either download Moment.js from the official website or include it from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.29.1/moment.min.js"></script>
```

## Creating the Time Picker Component

Let's start by creating the HTML markup for our time picker component:

```html
<div class="time-picker">
  <input type="text" id="time-input" placeholder="Select a time">
  <div class="time-picker-dropdown">
    <!-- Dropdown content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

Next, we will write the JavaScript code to handle the time picker behavior:

```javascript
// Get the necessary DOM elements
const timeInput = document.getElementById('time-input');
const dropdown = document.querySelector('.time-picker-dropdown');

// Attach an event listener to the time input
timeInput.addEventListener('click', () => {
  dropdown.classList.toggle('show');
});

// Handle the selection of a time
dropdown.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  const selectedTime = event.target.innerText;
  timeInput.value = selectedTime;
  dropdown.classList.remove('show');
});
```

In the code above, we attach an event listener to the time input that toggles the visibility of the dropdown when it is clicked. The dropdown element is hidden by default using CSS styles. When a time is selected in the dropdown, we update the value of the time input and hide the dropdown.

## Using the Time Picker Component

To use the time picker component, simply include the HTML markup in your page and add some CSS styles to make it visually appealing. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the dropdown to fit your specific needs.

Here's an example of how you can use the time picker component:

```html
<form>
  <label for="appointment-time">Select an appointment time:</label>
  <div class="time-picker">
    <input type="text" id="appointment-time" placeholder="Select a time">
    <div class="time-picker-dropdown">
      <ul>
        <li>9:00 AM</li>
        <li>10:00 AM</li>
        <li>11:00 AM</li>
        <!-- Add more time options here -->
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</form>
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a simple time picker component using Moment.js. You can further enhance the component by adding validation, error handling, or additional features based on your requirements. Moment.js provides a powerful set of tools to work with dates and times, making it a versatile choice for handling time-related functionalities in web applications.
