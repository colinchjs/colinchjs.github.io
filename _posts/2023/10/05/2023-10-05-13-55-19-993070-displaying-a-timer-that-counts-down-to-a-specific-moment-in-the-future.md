In this example, we will use JavaScript to create a countdown timer that updates in real-time and displays the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until a given date and time.

First, let's create a basic HTML structure with elements for days, hours, minutes, and seconds:

```html
<div id="countdown">
  <div>
    <span id="days"></span> days
  </div>
  <div>
    <span id="hours"></span> hours
  </div>
  <div>
    <span id="minutes"></span> minutes
  </div>
  <div>
    <span id="seconds"></span> seconds
  </div>
</div>
```

Next, we will write some JavaScript code to compute the remaining time and update the HTML elements:

```javascript
// Set the target date and time (e.g. December 31, 2022 23:59:59)
const targetDate = new Date("December 31, 2022 23:59:59").getTime();

// Update the countdown every second
setInterval(() => {
  // Get the current date and time
  const now = new Date().getTime();

  // Calculate the remaining time
  const remainingTime = targetDate - now;

  // Calculate the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds
  const days = Math.floor(remainingTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  const hours = Math.floor(
    (remainingTime % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60)
  );
  const minutes = Math.floor((remainingTime % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
  const seconds = Math.floor((remainingTime % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);

  // Update the HTML elements with the remaining time
  document.getElementById("days").textContent = days;
  document.getElementById("hours").textContent = hours;
  document.getElementById("minutes").textContent = minutes;
  document.getElementById("seconds").textContent = seconds;
}, 1000);
```

Now, when you load the webpage, you will see a countdown timer that updates in real-time and displays the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the target date and time.

Feel free to customize the target date and time according to your specific requirements. You can modify the `targetDate` variable to set your desired countdown moment.

With this countdown timer, you can create engaging and time-sensitive user experiences in your web applications. Whether it's counting down to a product release or building excitement for an upcoming event, the countdown timer is a versatile and powerful tool. #countdowntimer #javascript
