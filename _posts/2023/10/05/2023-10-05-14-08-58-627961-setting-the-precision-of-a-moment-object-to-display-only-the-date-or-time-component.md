When working with dates and times in JavaScript, the *Moment.js* library is a popular choice due to its flexibility and ease of use. One common requirement is to display only the date or time component of a *Moment.js* object.

## Displaying Only the Date Component

To display only the date component of a *Moment.js* object, you can use the `format()` function along with the `'YYYY-MM-DD'` format string. Here's an example:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

const dateTime = moment(); // Current date and time
const dateOnly = dateTime.format('YYYY-MM-DD');

console.log(dateOnly); // Output: 2022-07-20
```

In the example above, the `format()` function is called with the `'YYYY-MM-DD'` format string, which specifies that only the year, month, and day components should be included in the output.

## Displaying Only the Time Component

To display only the time component of a *Moment.js* object, you can use the `format()` function along with the `'HH:mm:ss'` format string. Here's an example:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

const dateTime = moment(); // Current date and time
const timeOnly = dateTime.format('HH:mm:ss');

console.log(timeOnly); // Output: 23:45:30
```

In the example above, the `format()` function is called with the `'HH:mm:ss'` format string, which specifies that only the hour, minute, and second components should be included in the output.

## Conclusion

By utilizing the `format()` function with the appropriate format strings, you can easily control the precision of a *Moment.js* object and display only the date or time component as needed. This flexibility makes *Moment.js* a powerful tool for working with dates and times in JavaScript.
