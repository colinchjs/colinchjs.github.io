When working with dates, it's common to encounter date strings that do not follow the standard date format patterns recognized by JavaScript's `Date` object. In such cases, parsing the date string can be challenging. However, using a powerful library like Moment.js, we can easily parse non-standard date strings and work with them effortlessly.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to parse a non-standard date string using Moment.js, and then format and manipulate the resulting date object.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:
- Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager)

## Installing Moment.js
To get started, let's install Moment.js as a dependency in our project. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
npm install moment
```

This command will download and install Moment.js in your project's `node_modules` directory.

## Parsing a Non-Standard Date String
Once Moment.js is installed, we can use it to parse non-standard date strings. The key is to provide the date string and the corresponding format pattern to Moment.js.

Here's an example of how to parse a non-standard date string using Moment.js:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

const dateStr = '18_04_2022';
const formatPattern = 'DD_MM_YYYY';

const parsedDate = moment(dateStr, formatPattern);

console.log(parsedDate);
```

In the example above, we first import Moment.js using `require`. Then, we define our date string as `dateStr` and our non-standard format pattern as `formatPattern`.

We then use `moment(dateStr, formatPattern)` to parse the date string and store the resulting date object in `parsedDate`.

Finally, we log the `parsedDate` object to the console to see the parsed result.

## Formatting and Manipulating the Date Object
Once we have the parsed date object, we can easily format and manipulate it using Moment.js's various functions and methods.

Here are a few examples of how to format and manipulate the parsed date object:

```javascript
// Format the date object
const formattedDate = parsedDate.format('dddd, MMMM Do YYYY');
console.log(formattedDate);

// Extract specific date components
const dayOfWeek = parsedDate.format('dddd');
const dayOfMonth = parsedDate.format('Do');
console.log(`The parsed date is on ${dayOfWeek}, ${dayOfMonth}`);

// Add or subtract time from the date object
const modifiedDate = parsedDate.add(1, 'day');
console.log(modifiedDate);
```

In the code snippets above, we demonstrate how to format the parsed date using `format()`. We can provide different format strings to get the desired format.

We also showcase how to extract specific date components from the parsed date using `format()`.

Finally, we use the `add()` method to add one day to the parsed date and verify the modified date.

## Conclusion
By leveraging Moment.js, parsing non-standard date strings becomes a breeze. We can easily format and manipulate the resulting date object to suit our needs.

Remember to install Moment.js as a dependency in your project, and then provide the date string and format pattern to the `moment()` function to parse the date string.

So next time you're faced with parsing a non-standard date string, feel confident knowing that you can rely on Moment.js to handle it effortlessly!
