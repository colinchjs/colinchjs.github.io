In this blog post, we will explore how to calculate the number of months between two given moments using Moment.js, a popular JavaScript library for date and time manipulation.

## Introduction

Moment.js provides a powerful set of functions for working with dates and times in JavaScript. One common use case is to calculate the difference between two moments in terms of months. However, by default, Moment.js considers partial months as a whole month. In this post, we will learn how to exclude partial months from the calculation.

## Excluding partial months

To exclude partial months from the calculation, we need to use Moment.js's `diff` method with a custom rounding option. The `diff` method calculates the difference between two moments in terms of a specified unit, such as months or years.

```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

const startDate = moment('2022-01-15');
const endDate = moment('2022-06-20');

const monthsDiff = Math.floor(endDate.diff(startDate, 'months', true));
```

In the code above, we initialize two moment objects `startDate` and `endDate` with the respective start and end dates. The `diff` method is then used to calculate the difference in months between the two moments. By passing `true` as the third argument of the `diff` method, we enable the precise calculation with decimal values.

Finally, we use `Math.floor` to round down the decimal value to the nearest whole number, excluding the partial month.

## Conclusion

Calculating the number of months between two moments is a common task in date and time manipulation. By using Moment.js's `diff` method with a custom rounding option, we can exclude partial months from the calculation.

Moment.js provides a wide range of functionality for working with dates and times, making it a powerful tool for handling various scenarios in JavaScript applications.
