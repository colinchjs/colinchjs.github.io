In many programming languages, there is a need to handle dates and times in various scenarios. [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies the manipulation, formatting, and parsing of dates and times.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a new moment object with the current date and time using Moment.js.

## Step 1: Install Moment.js

First, make sure you have Moment.js installed in your project. You can use npm to install it:

```bash
npm install moment
```

Alternatively, you can include the Moment.js library directly in your HTML file by adding the following script tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.29.1/moment.min.js"></script>
```

## Step 2: Create a new moment object with current date and time

To create a new moment object with the current date and time, you can use the `moment()` function without any arguments. Here's an example:

```javascript
const now = moment();
```

In this example, the `now` variable will hold a moment object representing the current date and time.

## Step 3: Accessing and manipulating the moment object

Once you have a moment object, you can access and manipulate different parts of it. Here are some common operations:

### Getting the current date and time

To get the current date and time as a string, you can use the `format()` function with a desired format. For example:

```javascript
const now = moment();
const formattedDateTime = now.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss');
console.log(formattedDateTime);
```

The `formattedDateTime` variable will hold a string representing the current date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`.

### Manipulating the moment object

You can also manipulate the moment object by adding or subtracting time units. For example:

```javascript
const now = moment();
const futureDateTime = now.add(1, 'hour');
console.log(futureDateTime.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'));
```

In this example, we add 1 hour to the current moment object and then format it as a string.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can easily create a new moment object with the current date and time using the Moment.js library. This can be helpful when dealing with various date and time scenarios in your JavaScript applications.

Remember to include Moment.js in your project and utilize its extensive API for further manipulation and formatting of dates and times.
