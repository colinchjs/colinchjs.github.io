## Introduction
Calculating the difference between two dates is a common requirement in date-related applications. Moment.js simplifies this task by providing a comprehensive set of functions to handle various date calculations.

## Using Moment.js
Before we begin calculating the number of decades, let's quickly set up Moment.js in our project. You can either download the library from the official website or include it using a package manager like npm or yarn.

Once Moment.js is included in your project, you can use its functions by referencing the moment object.

## Calculating Decades
To calculate the number of decades between two moments, we need to find the difference in years and then divide it by 10. Moment.js provides the `diff` function to easily calculate the difference between two dates in different units, such as years, months, days, etc.

To calculate the number of decades, we can use the 'years' unit and divide it by 10.

## Example Code
Let's look at an example that calculates the number of decades between two moments using Moment.js:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

const moment1 = moment('2000-01-01');
const moment2 = moment('2020-12-31');

const numDecades = moment2.diff(moment1, 'years') / 10;

console.log('Number of decades:', numDecades);
```

In this example, we create two Moment.js moments representing the start and end dates. We then calculate the difference in years using the `diff` function and divide it by 10 to get the number of decades. Finally, we log the result to the console.

## Conclusion
Calculating the number of decades between two moments using Moment.js is straightforward and can be done using the `diff` function. Moment.js provides a simple and efficient way to handle date-related calculations, making date manipulation in JavaScript easier.

By utilizing the Moment.js library, you can perform various date calculations quickly and accurately. Whether you need to calculate decades, days, hours, or any other time unit, Moment.js has you covered.
