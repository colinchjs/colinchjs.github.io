When working with dates and times in JavaScript, Moment.js is a widely used library that provides a simple and effective way to manipulate, format, and parse dates in a browser or Node.js environment.

One common task is adjusting a given date object to the last day of its month. This could be useful, for example, when displaying a calendar or when performing calculations that require the end of the month date.

Fortunately, Moment.js provides a straightforward method called `endOf()` that allows us to adjust a moment object to the end of a given unit of time.

To set a moment object to the last day of the month, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Include Moment.js in your project
To get started, make sure you have included the Moment.js library in your project. You can include it by downloading the library or by using a package manager like npm or Yarn.

```javascript
// Assuming the library was installed using npm
const moment = require('moment');
```

Step 2: Create a moment object
```javascript
const myDate = moment('2022-03-15');
```

Step 3: Adjust the moment object to the last day of the month
```javascript
const lastDayOfMonth = myDate.endOf('month');
```

The `endOf('month')` function adjusts the moment object to the end of the month by setting the date to the last day and setting the time to 23:59:59.999.

Step 4: Retrieve the adjusted date
To retrieve the adjusted date object, we can use the `toDate()` method.

```javascript
const lastDayOfMonthDate = lastDayOfMonth.toDate();
console.log(lastDayOfMonthDate);
```

The `toDate()` method returns a native JavaScript Date object, which can be easily used in further calculations or formatting.

That's it! You have successfully adjusted a moment object to the last day of its month using Moment.js. By following these steps, you can easily manipulate and transform date objects in your JavaScript projects.

Remember to include the Moment.js library in your project and explore its extensive documentation for more date and time manipulation features it offers.
