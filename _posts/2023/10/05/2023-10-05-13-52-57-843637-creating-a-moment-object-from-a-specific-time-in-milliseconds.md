In JavaScript, the Moment.js library provides a convenient way to work with dates and times. If you have a specific time represented in milliseconds and you want to create a `Moment` object from it, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const timeInMilliseconds = 1627945200000; // Example value, replace with your own
const momentObject = moment(timeInMilliseconds);
```

In the code above, we first define a `timeInMilliseconds` variable representing the specific time you want to convert. Replace the value with your own.

Then, we use the `moment()` function provided by the Moment.js library, passing in the `timeInMilliseconds` value. This will create a `Moment` object representing the specified time.

You can now use the `momentObject` to perform various operations on the time, such as formatting it, manipulating it, or extracting specific components like the year, month, day, etc.

Here's an example of formatting the `momentObject` as a string:

```javascript
const formattedTime = momentObject.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss');
console.log(formattedTime);
```

This will output the formatted time as a string in the `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` format.

By using Moment.js, you can easily work with dates and times in JavaScript, including creating `Moment` objects from specific timestamps in milliseconds.
