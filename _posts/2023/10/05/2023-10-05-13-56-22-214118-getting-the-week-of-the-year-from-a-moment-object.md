In this blog post, we'll explore how to get the week of the year from a Moment.js object. Moment.js is a popular JavaScript library for parsing, manipulating, and formatting dates.

To get the week of the year from a Moment.js object, you can use the `week()` function. This function returns the week of the year as a number (from 1 to 52 or 53).

Here's an example of how to use the `week()` function:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment');

const date = moment('2021-05-29');
const weekOfYear = date.week();

console.log(weekOfYear);
```

In the code above, we first import Moment.js using `require()` and create a Moment.js object `date` representing the date May 29, 2021. We then call the `week()` function on the `date` object to get the week of the year. Finally, we log the result to the console.

The output of the above code would be `22`, as May 29, 2021 falls into the twenty-second week of the year.

It's important to note that the week of the year calculation depends on the locale. By default, Moment.js uses the ISO week numbering standard, where the first week of the year is the week that contains January 4th. If you need to use a different week numbering standard, you can specify it with the `moment().locale()` function.

In conclusion, obtaining the week of the year from a Moment.js object is straightforward using the `week()` function. Whether you need it for date calculations, reporting, or any other purpose, Moment.js provides an easy way to get this information.
