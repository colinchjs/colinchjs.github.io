## Introduction to Moment.js

[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com) is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows you to parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript. It provides a simple and intuitive API for working with dates and times, making it an ideal choice for handling various date-related operations in your web applications.

## Installing and Setting Up Moment.js

To use Moment.js in your project, you need to include the library in your HTML file. You can either download the Moment.js file and host it locally or include it from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like this:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.29.1/moment.min.js"></script>
```

Once you have included the Moment.js library, you're ready to start using its powerful features.

## Creating a Custom Formatted Date

To create a custom formatted date using Moment.js, we can utilize the `format()` method. This method allows us to define a custom date string using a combination of format tokens.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to create a custom formatted date:

```javascript
const now = moment();
const formattedDate = now.format("YYYY-MM-DD | HH:mm:ss");

console.log(formattedDate);
```

In the code snippet above, we first create a Moment.js object `now` representing the current date and time. Then, we use the `format()` method to format the date in the specified format. In this case, we're using the format string `"YYYY-MM-DD | HH:mm:ss"` to define the desired format, which displays the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` followed by a pipe character, and then the time in the format `HH:mm:ss`.

Running the above code will output the current date and time in the custom format, for example: `2022-12-31 | 23:59:59`.

Feel free to experiment with different format strings and tokens to create your desired custom date format.

## Conclusion

Moment.js is a powerful JavaScript library for working with dates and times. By utilizing the `format()` method, we can easily create custom formatted dates according to our specific requirements. With Moment.js, handling and manipulating dates becomes simpler and more efficient.
