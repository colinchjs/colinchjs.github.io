When you want to display a countdown timer on your website, Moment.js library can be a great tool to achieve this. Moment.js is a widely used JavaScript library for handling dates, times, and durations.

## Setting up Moment.js
First, you need to include the Moment.js library into your HTML file. You can either download the library from the Moment.js website or use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to include it in your project. Here, we will use the CDN method:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.29.1/moment.min.js"></script>
```

## Creating the Countdown Timer
To create a countdown timer, you need to specify the target date and time you want to count down to. Let's say we want to create a countdown timer for New Year's Eve:

```javascript
// Get the target datetime
const targetDate = moment('2022-01-01 00:00:00');

// Update the timer every second
setInterval(updateCountdown, 1000);

function updateCountdown() {
  // Get the current datetime
  const now = moment();

  // Calculate the remaining time
  const duration = moment.duration(targetDate - now);

  // Format the remaining time in HH:mm:ss format
  const hours = Math.floor(duration.asHours());
  const minutes = Math.floor(duration.asMinutes()) % 60;
  const seconds = Math.floor(duration.asSeconds()) % 60;

  // Display the countdown timer on your webpage
  document.getElementById('timer').innerHTML = `${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`;  
}
```

In the above code, we first define the target date and time using Moment.js. Then, we create a function `updateCountdown()` that will be called every second to update the countdown timer. Inside this function, we calculate the remaining time by subtracting the current datetime from the target datetime. Finally, we format the remaining time and display it on the webpage.

## Updating the Countdown Timer
To keep the countdown timer up-to-date, we need to call the `updateCountdown()` function at regular intervals. In the previous code snippet, we used `setInterval()` to update the countdown timer every second. However, you can adjust the interval according to your needs.

That's it! You have successfully created a countdown timer using Moment.js. Feel free to customize the styling of the displayed timer to match your website's design.
