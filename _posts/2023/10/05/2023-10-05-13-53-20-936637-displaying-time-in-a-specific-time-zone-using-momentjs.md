In this blog post, we will learn how to display time in a specific time zone using Moment.js, a popular JavaScript library for manipulating and formatting dates and times.

To get started, make sure you have Moment.js installed in your project:

```javascript
npm install moment
```

Now, let's assume you want to display the current time in New York's Eastern Standard Time (EST) zone. Here's how you can achieve that using Moment.js:

```javascript
const moment = require('moment-timezone');

const newYorkTime = moment().tz('America/New_York');
console.log('Current time in New York:', newYorkTime.format('hh:mm A'));
```

In the code above, we import the `moment-timezone` module and create a new moment object using `moment()`. We then use the `tz()` method to specify the target time zone, which in this case is 'America/New_York'. Finally, we format the moment object using the `format()` method to display the time in the desired format.

The output will be something like:

```
Current time in New York: 09:32 PM
```

You can replace 'America/New_York' with any other valid time zone identifier to display the time in a different zone. Moment.js supports a wide range of time zone identifiers, including major cities and standard time zone abbreviations.

You can also manipulate the time by adding or subtracting hours, minutes, etc. For example, to display the time in New York after 3 hours:

```javascript
const newTime = newYorkTime.add(3, 'hours');
console.log('Time in New York after 3 hours:', newTime.format('hh:mm A'));
```

The output will be something like:

```
Time in New York after 3 hours: 12:32 AM
```

In this example, we use the `add()` method to add 3 hours to the `newYorkTime` object and then format and display the updated time.

Moment.js makes it easy to work with dates and times in JavaScript, including displaying them in different time zones. It provides a powerful and intuitive API for performing various date and time operations.

By incorporating Moment.js into your projects, you can ensure accurate and localized time displays based on the desired time zone.
