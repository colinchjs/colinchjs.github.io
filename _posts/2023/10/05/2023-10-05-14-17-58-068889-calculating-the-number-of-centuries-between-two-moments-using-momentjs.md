## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

When working with dates and times, it is often necessary to calculate the difference between two moments in specific units. In this case, we want to calculate the number of centuries between two given moments.

## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before we proceed, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript
- Moment.js library installed in your project

If you haven't installed Moment.js, you can do so by including the following line in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.29.1/moment.min.js"></script>
```

Once you have the prerequisites set up, let's move on to calculating the centuries.

## Calculating Centuries <a name="calculating-centuries"></a>

To calculate the number of centuries between two moments using Moment.js, use the `diff` method to get the difference between the moments and then divide it by the number of milliseconds in a century.

Here's an example code snippet:

```javascript
const moment1 = moment('1980-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD');
const moment2 = moment('2022-10-16', 'YYYY-MM-DD');

const centuries = moment2.diff(moment1) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25 * 100);

console.log(`Number of centuries between the moments: ${centuries}`);
```

In this code, we first create two Moment.js objects representing the moments we want to compare. We then use the `diff` method to calculate the difference between `moment2` and `moment1`. Finally, we divide this difference by the number of milliseconds in a century to get the number of centuries.

The output will be the number of centuries between the two moments.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

By using Moment.js, we can easily calculate the number of centuries between two moments. This can be useful in various applications that involve working with dates and times, such as age calculations or historical data analysis.

Remember to include the Moment.js library in your project before using its functionalities. Moment.js offers a wide range of features for manipulating and displaying dates, making it a valuable tool for any JavaScript developer.
